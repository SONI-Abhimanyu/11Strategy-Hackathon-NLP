1,Business class product is awful,M Garman,United Kingdom,6th January 2022,1, A330 Business class product is awful. Was no selection of food and was given a very bland pasta despite having a gluten intolerance. Cabin AC was faulty and stuck on lowest setting. Cabin crew did the best they could. Customer services response was pathetic.,Air France ,Business Class,A330-200,2x2x2
2,in bed mode it is very lumpy,M Keales,United States,9th February 2020,1," The business class seat had plenty of room, and I liked that it was a pod-style (so I had decent privacy). My biggest complaint is the comfort when in bed mode it is very lumpy with the lumbar protruding into your back.  AF has invested a lot into these seats, and they could be great if they would only take the time to work on them a bit. A lay-flat bed that protrudes into your back is not OK. Tried using an extra blanket to make the bed more comfy but it didn't work. Please Air France, improve the comfort of the cushions for bed mode.",Air France ,Business Class,Boeing 777,1x2x1
1,seat was so small,R Hargal,India,26th January 2020,1, I had done online check in for economy seats fairly forward but at boarding gate in paris they changed the seat to somewhere at the back where the planes width narrows. The seat was so small & rigid & once the guy in front of me reclined his seat i felt so claustrophobic. For the sake on entertainment in an 11hr plus flight which was further delayed by 2hrs was a tiny screen with little content & a malfunctioning headphone with audio only in one ear.  I did not have high expectations but this was the worst experience.,Air France ,Economy Class,A330-200,2x4x2
2,ashamed to offer such cabins,A Rabouyre,Switzerland,6th November 2019,1," Lima to Paris on a Boeing 777-300. Once you enter the cabin you get thrown back into the 90s and not in a good way. The entertainment system is old with a couple of movies. The screen was barely bigger than my phone and with terrible quality, and you need to navigate using the bulky remotes. No plugs to charge the phone. The seats have almost no recline and are quite narrow. Worst part is that now Air France makes you pay to select certain seats (front section seats, emergency seats, etc.) and the price can go from 30 to 100 CHF the seat for 1 leg! Air France should be ashamed to offer such cabins at the same price as new cabins.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
1,cramped and could not sleep,J Kareshir,United States,27th June 2019,1," Paris and Amman, A320 business class seats were nothing but economy class seats with no difference between these two classes. No leg room, minimally reclinable, felt cramped and could not sleep. They separate economy class seats from business class seats by a curtain to label it as business class. Only relief was at least they provided business class service in terms of meals etc otherwise it could have been a disaster. ",Air France ,Business Class,A320,3x3
2,the worst business class,Edmund Tai,United States,27th May 2019,0," Flew from San Francisco to Paris with AF flight 82. The business class seat is very disappointing. I have flown with mulitple airlines business class and this is similar to what we had to endure about 10 years ago when the seats was ""angled flat"". when in full ""recline"" the seat feels like it is sliding downward. I usually can sleep on flat beds for 5-6 hrs comfortably but with this sleep was not possible. This made it the worst business class experience.",Air France ,Business Class,A380,2x2x2
4,the worst Business class,H Miller,United Kingdom,16th May 2019,1, This was the worst Business class long haul flight I have ever been on. I didn't even know that the long haul business class flights came with a 2x3x2 formation with reclining seatsinstead of beds. The seats do not lay flat so you slide down them when trying to sleep - not great for people with back problems. There is hardly any space between the chairs so you have strangers climbing over you every time they want to get up. It felt like Premium Economy seats for Business Class prices. I complained afterwards and have been completely ignored by Air France.,Air France ,Business Class,Boeing 777,2x3x2
10,Recline was very nice,L Neale,United States,7th February 2019,1," Fantastic plane and service was friendly too. Recline was very nice, with a good thick footrest. Noise canceling headphones in premium economy, shell type seats that kept the seat in front from reclining into you and a very plush blanket made this almost like a business lite experience. Amenity kit with the anniversary logo comes in a few colors, contains toothbrush, sleep mask socks and earplugs. Inflight entertainment has a huge selection, large screen was responsive and looks new. Had trouble with the AC power port in my seat but the usb worked. Dinner was unremarkable but the foie gras starter was very good. Breakfast was delicious, scrambled eggs with spinach and herbs, very flavorful!",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300ER,2x4x2
3,uncomfortable overnight seats,V Barden,United States,21st October 2018,1," I can’t believe we paid extra for this Premium Economy seats on a vacation with my wife and flying NYC-JFK to Paris. The seats do not recline but just kind of slide forward a little. Essentially there is no functional recline and they are the most uncomfortable overnight seats I have ever flown on, including coach. And that is saying something because I fly a lot. We would have rather have tried the coach seats as they could not be worse. Very disappointed in these seats and the engineering is horrible. Not for nothing, but I remember way back in the day flying Air France in just coach and being very impressed by the coffee and food quality. In Premium Economy this time it tasted like instant powdered coffee.",Air France ,Premium Economy,A380,2x4x2
1,go back to their old seats,E Kalanova,Netherlands,17th August 2018,1, I used to like flying with Air France but after this flight I will try to avoid them. They changed their seats to similar ones they have on short haul flights. They are bearable when you need to fly 1-2 hours during day time but not when it’s a 6 hours transatlantic night flight. I don’t even want to imagine what a 10 hours + flight feels on those seats. The people who designed those seats probably never even had the chance to sit on them because otherwise such seat would not be existing! Air France is better to go back to their old seats.,Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
2,they were very uncomfortable,D Marlee,Hong Kong,27th July 2018,1," 
It must have been new seats and they were very uncomfortable for a 11hrs flight. It doesn’t reclines and the leg rest only allows your calf muscles to rest. Just horrible and will be thinking twice now as flying economy might just save me money as the comfort is probably about the same!",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300,2x4x2
3,Seats are very uncomfortable,C Heany,Ireland,21st March 2018,1," Fly out to São Paulo via CDG in economy and back in Premium Economy in 20C. I could not recommend the extra for Premium. Seats are very uncomfortable and despite different planes in the past the experience has always been negative. Seat is designed by someone who never sat in them for 10+ hours. There is practically no recline. Economy seats are better. Food no different. Service indifferent. As the premium is located towards the front, the toilets are in the next cabin back. No chance of using business due to they ever vigilant crew, who only appeared to serve the food and little else. Flight delayed by 3 hours causing missed connections etc. an ever increasing problem with AF, the third occasion since start of year ! Movies choice dominated by French films with little new releases and no change on outward leg.",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777,242
10,I thought it was fine,K Marson,United States,2nd November 2017,," San Francisco to Paris return. Excellent Flight for the approx extra 30% on the fare. Separate Cabin small cabin, which is nice, upper deck sharing with Business Class. The flight crew was  professional and very courteous. The window seats get a little extra storage with a sort of ""locker"" next to the armrest and the window which is nice to have. Big enough for a purse and a backpack so we did not have to use the overhead. Lots of cubbyholes and holders for glasses, etc. Entertainment system was good, large selection of films, TV, music etc. Food and service was good. Lots of room. The seats: Ok big debate on this. The seats are in a fixed ""pod"" so the upside is that with the seat in front reclining or the seat in back pushing their tray table, it does not move your seat at all. But the seat does not actually recline, it sort of slides down in the pod to affect a reclining feeling. Honestly after 2 transatlantic crossings, I thought it was fine. Also for the price you get: Sky Priority Check in, Luggage, Boarding and Security (and Passport Control if applicable) so that is a huge time saver. I recommend it and the wife and I will be Flying Blue in PE again for sure.",Air France ,Premium Economy,A380,2x3x2
8,Seat recline not enough,Laurent Charpentier,France,2nd November 2017,," Seat 11B. Premium Economy with AF is a good flight : enough space for legs, width OK. In flight service personalized and good quality. Good meals with good wines (important issue for french passengers). Seat recline not enough for night flights.",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-200,2x4x2
1,we had to suffer instead,B Kagonis,United States,12th October 2017,," I was returning from our European honeymoon and paid extra for Duo/2 seats 16K and 16L at the back of the premium economy cabin to enjoy a bit of quiet time on our flight from CDG to BOS. Unknown to me was the fact Air France cancelled our reservation for reasons never fully explained. We spent an hour in NCE with the agent trying to get seats for both our flights home. We begged the agent to upgrade us to business class and but he refused. Air France assigned us seats 15K and 15L telling us they were the same and we would be happy. What they never explained was this was a 3 seat and not a 2 seat row! How sneaky of them to not tell us it was not what we paid for. The arm between our seats was fixed in the down position and I suffered the indignity of having my seat back kick by the brat and his mommy who got my original seat. I am still confused why they were not assigned to new seats, but we had to suffer instead. Air France refused to grant us any consideration, refunds, credits for our terrible experience that had me an my new wife exchanging hash words. ",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777,3x4x3
9,Lots of space,Tamara Denby,United Kingdom,26th May 2017,, Row 93 K/L on the A380 were excellent seats. No one behind you as the loos were there. No big queues for toilets. Lots of space. Foot rests. Large window storage bins. The seat padding wasn't excellent but it was fine for our 10 hour journey. I would definitely pick these seats again.,Air France ,Economy Class,A380,2-4-2
6,seats were not that comfortable,Linda Vernel,Australia,25th April 2017,, This A380 premium economy seat does not recline instead it slides forward. There is no support for lower legs just a footrest attached to the seat in front. I found it best to keep the chair in the standard upright position with my feet on the footrest to push me back into the seat otherwise I had no lumbar support. I had a window seat so was able to rest against it and managed to set some sleep. There was plenty of space width wise. Because the seat didn't recline you did not have the seat in front encroaching on your space. The tray table was in the armrest. When the tray table was folded away there was no dedicated cup holder or place to store a water bottle. Headphones had good sound quality but I found they hurt my ears after a while (I was on a 13hr flight). There was adequate aisle space to walk. Overall the seats were not that comfortable considering I was flying Premium Economy.,Air France ,Premium Economy,A380-800,2x4x2
1,discomfort of the seats,M Taville,France,7th April 2017,," I'm used to fly with Air France as it is my home airline. On my last 14-hours flight from Singapore to Paris, I've been really upset by the discomfort of the seats, which appeared to be relatively new though. A 3x4x3 Boeing 777-300 cabin layout for a 14-hour flights lets you imagine how packed we were, not able to move a muscle. My neighbor was sleeping on me half of the time, I had no place to go exercise a bit to avoid any health issue and moving alors the corridors without waking up the passengers was nearly impossible if you were not a size 4.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
4,not a good choice,Jean-Marie Humeau,France,2nd February 2017,," On my way back from New York to Paris, I flew on an A380. It was a night flight and I paid an extra fee because I wanted to stretch my legs. I had seat 11A. It was not a good choice : there is a partition in front of the seat, that prevents you from streching your legs. So, although you pay an extra fee, it is not as comfortable as a normal seat.",Air France ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
5,fairly uncomfortable,Nico Echeverri,Colombia,20th January 2017,," Flew Air France from Paris CDG to Bogota, the 11 hour flight was fairly uncomfortable due to the economy seats provided by Air France. I am a tall man and the leg room was minimal, left the airplane with severe knee aches due to not being able to barely stretch my legs. I hope Air France improve their seats in the near future.",Air France ,Economy Class,A340,2x4x2
4,still much too upright ,Guido Stoldt,Germany,2nd December 2016,," First time in the Air France Premium Economy seat, from Paris to Bangkok. Two seats less (2-4-2) than in Economy (3-4-3). The distance to the front seat it good, also Sky Priority privileges. Food was exactly the same like in Economy but in a better presentation. The seat is fine for a long day-flight, but for a night-flight concerning the sleeping comfort I do not see any advantage, it is definitely still much too upright to relax or have a good sleep!",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300,2x4x2
1,seats were the worst,J Tramell,United States,24th October 2016,," My wife and I flew from Detroit to Rome with a stop in Paris (CDG) on Air France in Premium Economy. The seats were the worst I've had in making a transatlantic flight. The clamshell design is hard and extremely uncomfortable with no real recline and a weak excuse for leg support. I traded my return tickets in for Economy and pitched a huge fit for the inconvenience, discomfort, and lack of cooperation in returning any money and they finally gave me a $200 per ticket travel voucher. ",Air France ,Premium Economy,A340-300,2x3x2
5,seats mediocre to moderate,D Callow,United States,18th October 2016,," I flew out of Boston to Paris on an approximate 6 hour flight. The flight itself was great, and the airline was good as well, but the seats on this flight were mediocre to moderate. The recline was limited, and if someone reclined in front of you, your space was greatly limited. Also, the middle seats only had space under 3 of the 4 seats in front of them, which led to one person in the row unable to store their bag in front of them. Lastly, the seats were comfortable enough, but they were certainly not exceptional or my first choice. On the other hand, they had a great entertainment touchscreen on the back of the seat in front of them, and were fully equipped for an enjoyable flight. Overall, the seats were decent but the airline certainly Made up for them.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x4x3
6,middle seat serves as armrest,S Gigano,Italy,14th September 2016,," Milan to Paris CDG in Business class. The configuration in this class is 2x2, so the middle seat serves as armrest. Nothing special, a short flight, discreet service. A very dated aircraft, like many of the short-range Air France aircraft.",Air France ,Premium Economy,A318,2x2
3,seats do not recline enough,N Spurr,United Kingdom,12th September 2016,,"Flying from LAX to CDG on 7 September. The aircraft stood on the tarmac for 90 minutes after door closing minutes with no explanation and no air conditioning. The seats are very upright, making them most uncomfortable. They do not recline enough to give any comfort. Cushion foam is not supportive, I could feel the support bars of the seat frame. Legroom just about acceptable but short cushion length gives no thigh support. Entertainment screen has very poor resolution and flight information is woeful, with no information regarding speed, height or time to destination. Entertainment system itself is about the most difficult to navigate and slow to respond. Seems to be of a generation before the A380.",Air France ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
9,I was positively surprised,Gaspard Smith-vaniz,France,12th September 2016,,"This was my first time flying the A380 and I was positively surprised. Seats are larger, the seat recline was also better than on the A330s or 767s. There are large personal TV screens, with a good range of choices in Music and movies. I was next to the window, and there are 2 people you have to go over if you need to go to the restrooms. Passengers are provided with small blakets and pillows (that are very nice actually). Storage bins were the biggest I have seen so far. ",Air France ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
10,catch a few winks on my AF flights,C Tok,Singapore,20th July 2016,,"This was my second time travelling on Air France and also the second time I've been assigned an extra leg room seat on AF, even though at 5ft 2, I don't really need it. I read and heard a lot of bad reviews before so I was not expecting much but for the sake of travelling directly from Singapore to Paris, I decided to just rough it. Both times I've had excellent service, staff are very polite, elegant and pleasing, always offering wine or champagne routinely. Food was surprisingly amazing, in fact of all the airlines I've been on so far the food on Air France was the best. The wine was pretty good. I can't believe they even got dessert done right! I usually find it hard to sleep on planes but so far I've been able to catch a few winks on my AF flights. I did also witness an AF staff dealing with a very rude and loud passenger on my flight who had another passenger occupying her seat. The passenger occupying this passenger's seat had refused to take her designated seat as her daughter was seated next to her. In this scenario, I thought he dealt with the passenger very elegantly but sometimes you know, passengers can be just kind of unreasonable. It wasn't a very full flight and this person had the choice of seating somewhere else easily but was just being very difficult. I'm travelling on Air France again this weekend and am keeping my fingers crossed for a lucky trip no. 3! Looking forward to my glass of champagne already!",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing777-300ER,3x4x3
8,Air France customer review,Charlie Lebreton,France,18th July 2016,,"The Boeing 777-300aircraft had the summer seat layout, with Business, Economy, Premium Economy and Economy again. This configuration is called QuickChange layout. I was seating at 19A, lot of space in front of me, the new Air France best cabin Economy offers a really good recline. In this area, the seats are more costly, but the space is much better than elsewhere in Economy. Food was really good, wine was offered twice, champagne for appetizer, and liquor after dessert. In flight entertainement had an OK amount of films, and diverse series. Maybe IFE needs a little improvement in terms of content, display is very satisfying. Cabin crew was pleasing and helpful.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
3,poor value for price,Jean-Yves Charre,France,1st June 2016,, Flight AF017 departing from JFK at 6.20pm and arriving at CDG at 7.45am. Very poor value for price. The leather of the armrests of my seat was torn away. I was seating on seat 19B. Good seat with plenty of leg room but this seat (and the next to it) are usually taken for families with toddlers. I had a young mother with a daughter of 2 years old and it was quite difficult at the beginning until she fell asleep. The entertainment system is outdated. Selection of films available is limited and the moving in the menu did not work in 50% of the cases (brings you back to home). I also found the quality of the food served and the quantity below average and not at par with the other flights I am usually taking with Air France in Economy class.  Air France crew did a great job as usual and is very attentive to your needs.,Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200 ER,3-4-3
1,most horrid seat,Sean Clarke,Ireland,1st May 2016,," The A380 business class has the most horrid seat we have ever sat in. It is not a seat, more a capsule. The huge issue here is that is does not recline. The whole thing just slides down to put you in the most painful awkward position you could imagine. We had a horrendous time and couldn't wait to get off the plane. I suffered back pain for days after. I honestly would have been more comfortable in economy and saved a heap of money.",Air France ,Premium Economy,A380,2x3x2
1,not fly Air France again,Sean Clarke,Ireland,1st May 2016,, It was actually Air France Business Class. We thought that these old fashioned seats has disappeared years ago in favour of the later lie flats. They are the old extra recline that we are not used to at all. Not worth the money for such antiquated seating. Sorry to say we will not fly Air France again for long haul.,Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777,2x3x2
2,A380 seats very uncomfortable,Daniel Wischenbarth,Austria,19th April 2016,,"Air France A380 seats are very uncomfortable. This was my first and most likely only long-haul flight with Air France in 10 years. The seat cushions are too stiff and hard for a long flight. Your legs and butt start feeling numb after 2 hours, it's impossible to sleep and when you do get up to move around you will find that there's literally no space for that, either. The aisles are extremely narrow, the back of the plane allows for a maximum of 3 people standing there. The 11 hour flight almost felt like eternity. ",Air France ,Economy Class,A380-800,2x4x2
8,a little tight,Ron Levangie,Canada,13th February 2016,,"We flew Air France Boeing 777-200 from Toronto to Bangalore via Paris. On our flight to Paris we had a window and middle seat. The aisle seat was vacant. This made the flight much more pleasant as we were able to get up when we wanted to. On the Paris to Bangalore flight we purchased the 2 seat for an additional $41 each which seemed to be a waste since we were the only ones who paid and other people that were sitting in the middle row moved to these seats. On our return we chose not to purchase these seats, unfortunately the return flights were full and we were stuck sitting at the window and middle seats. A little tight and harder to get up as they person on the aisle was always sleeping. Seat comfort is terrible, doesn't matter what airline you fly. Put a few extra pillows on my bottom for more comfort.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x4x3
3,seat was very narrow,Carole Parker,United Kingdom,27th January 2016,,"Seat was very narrow, and the plane was also very full. I have flown transatlantic several times, but this was the first time with Air France. I was so disappointed, I expected a wider seat.  On the return journey I chose Premium Economy and that was of course much more comfortable. The amazing thing was that the connecting flight with Air France from CDG to Heathrow had great seat pitch, with the flight taking only 45 mins.  The cabin crew were very good! I wouldn't fly with AF again.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
8,plenty of room,Andrew Streit,United States,25th January 2016,,"This flight was from JFK-CDG, so I was in the seat for about 7.5 hours. I am 6'3"" (195 cm), and I had plenty of room in the seat when I wasn't reclined. The seat has a USB port, which I used to charge my phone (albeit slowly). I also learned that when a USB drive is plugged into the port, the in-flight entertainment system (IFE) can display videos on the drive. The IFE was definitely large enough, as was the tray table. The only problem I ran into was when I reclined to sleep, my knees hit the seat in front of me, which was uncomfortable. The overhead bins and underseat storage were plenty large enough for my carry on bag.",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
9,Air France customer review,Andrew Streit,United States,24th January 2016,,"The flight was an inter-European ""domestic"" flight from CDG to TXL, and as such only took about an hour and a half. Since it was a morning flight, a delicious chocolate croissant was served almost immediately after takeoff. The seat room was slightly too small (I am 6'4"" or 195 cm.), so I put my legs in the aisle to get more room (when there wasn't anyone else trying to use it).",Air France ,Economy Class,A320,3x3
2,10 abreast Boeing 777,Jim Neuhaus,France,20th January 2016,,"This is the narrowest seat I have traveled in, and it is very hard. As a result it is near impossible to sleep, and becomes painful after two hours of flight. Frequent position changes are the only way to accomodate the pain. Air France cram 10 seats abreast seats in a Boeing 777 (like Emirates etc), and it is clearly perceptible in the seat and armrest width. Even the aisles are hard to navigate with a bag.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
5,disappointed with the seats,Antonio Frongia,Spain,12th January 2016,,"I must say that for the price I paid - 380 Euros-  for a return flight from Malaga to New York JFK I shouldn't be complaining at all. However I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed with the seats: they were new but small and not comfortable at all. I am 5 feet 7 inches, so not exactly a giant, but still I haven't been able to find the right position and rest properly. The screen for the infotainment was old and small too. The good news is that there was a USB socket so I have been able to charge my iPad and watch movies on a decent size screen.",Air France ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
8,are very comfortable,Aurelien Guzzetti,Italy,23rd November 2015,,"Good Premium Economy seat with a good tv and good storage. The seats are old, but they are very comfortable. The tv is good but it isn't very easy to touch the screen. There is a big storage, but only near to the windows, so if you aren't near to the window you haven't any storage. I was near to the window.",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300ER,2x4x2
3,the seat is hard,S Davis,Canada,3rd November 2015,,The seat is a shell type setting and does not recline. You move downwards versus recline and the seat is hard and is very uncomfortable. There is a foot rest which helps but I did leave the aircraft with lower back pain as the seat positioning is awful. The leg room is fine if you want to sit upright but if you want to lower the seat forget it as the body mechanics you end up in prevent any type of comfort.,Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-200,2x3x2
1,Impossible to rest neither sleep,G Neumann,Argentina,21st September 2015,,"Buenos Aires to Paris return on Boeing 777. Seats narrow, the front seat almost on my face. Impossible to rest neither sleep. I'm 1,83m and wieght 84kgs. normal size. It so small the tray that it makes impossible to eat and the tray where they bring the meal is so tiny you can't eat. ",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
1,Premium Economy seats are dreadful,Sean Clarke,Ireland,2nd September 2015,,"Air France A380 Premium Economy seats are dreadful. They slide down and there is no recline. You will probably end up, like me and other reviewers here, with an aching back for days after and you will be very lucky to get any sleep. They offer no comfort whatsoever. I suffered this seat on an eleven hour flight. My partner is much shorter than me and she also found the seat dreadful. What on earth are you thinking of Air France to offer such a ridiculous seat for so much money? Premium economy is exactly that - a better experience, more room, more comfort and a more premium version of economy. We did not get any of this.",Air France ,Premium Economy,A380,2-4-2
5,seat recline was horrible,F Rohart,France,28th August 2015,,"This is the first time I fly with Air France for a long haul flight from France to Indonesia because they offered a very attractive price comparing to the airlines I usually take (Emirates and Qatar Airways). After reading the reviews before flying on this website, I was scared. But then the nightmare really did come to reality! The seat recline was horrible, and I could not really sleep during a 12 hours flight from CDG Paris to Kuala Lumpur (transit). I also felt that the seat was narrower than KLM's. Luckily the air crews were very nice and always offer water to the passengers. Since this is the old Boeing 777-200, the entertainment system was old too and offered a very limited choices. I chose a vegetarian meal, and I must say they were not the best. Toilets did not offer too many things, but they were quite clean.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x4x3
3,seat does not recline,Linda Lander,Australia,6th August 2015,,"The design is a capsule where the seat does not recline but slides down in a fixed position and while you gain no comfort from this shift, you lose leg room as the capsule moves into your available leg room.  The other issue is that there are inadequate toilets with wait times of 30 minutes or longer as the line of passengers grows and the wait becomes painful. Things like having no place to put your coat, the lack of adequate toilet facilities and the rediculat but expensive capsule seats in premium economy make this a costly and uncomfortable option.",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777,Premium Economy
6,knees often banged the seat in front,Jason Poh,Singapore,30th June 2015,,"SIN-CDG and back on Air France economy class. Decent in flight entertainment,  no flight delays. Leg room is little, and my knees often banged the seat in front of me, seat is too narrow, I ended up rubbing shoulders with other passengers whenever we moved about our seats.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
10,a really good surprise,Habile Buston,United States,11th June 2015,,"I'm not used to travelling with Air France and it has been a really good surprise for me when I discovered the new cabin! The seats are well designed, the headrests are covered with leather, there is an individual pillow (which is aesthetically pleasant) for each seat and the legroom is quite good (I'm tall). But the most impressive thing is the HD screen! In Economy Class, having a such beautiful screen is uncommon. The seat recline is not the best I have known but that's correct. I really appreciated the service and I love the new brand image, built on the French values (the safety video is adorable). I do recommend this airline for a long-haul flight!",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
1,leg rest is painful,J Sappington,United States,10th May 2015,,LAX to CDG was hell! These seats do not recline forcing the weight of your body to rest on your bottom. The leg rest is painful too small poor design. The thigh support does not come up high enough to touch your thighs making it worthless. On the return flight I put a carry on under the seat in front in front of me and used it as a foot rest. I would rather have a seat that reclined and deal with the seat in front of me intruding into my space. The premium economy seats share a bathroom with economy making for long waits.,Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2
4,makes sleeping very difficult,Ashley Johnson,United Kingdom,10th May 2015,,Everything about the PE seats on AF from CDG-BKK is very good from lounge access with air mile points to priority boarding dedicated check-in desks food movie entertainment size of seats etc. Mind the red wine can be very poor. The big issue is the seat recline which is virtually non-existent and less than most airlines economy which makes sleeping very difficult as you are bolt upright.,Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 777,2x4x2
9,legroom is absolutely dazzling,L Cohen,United States,10th May 2015,,This was great! I flew LAX-CDG and back and liked it a lot. I mean the legroom is absolutely dazzling and the seat recline was great (well I'm short) and the shell seat is great because you don't have to have the seat in front of you in your face. If you feel like you're not lucky to be in this small cabin (the upper deck one is the only one on the plane) look at the economy passengers behind you! I felt like how low the seats were made it so that it was a bit difficult to view the screen. But this was hardly noticeable. Again I'm short!,Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A380,2x3x2
8,found the seating as comfortable,A Jeffery,United Kingdom,29th March 2015,,"Sat in seats 46G and 46H on AF 0642 Orly to St. Denis Réunion (RUN) and was pleasantly surprised after reading some bad reviews. My perceptions of the level of comfort may be slightly different as I am 5' 1"" and was seated next to a small child however my husband (5' 11"") also found the seating as comfortable as on economy class on any other scheduled European airline. This row is immediately behind the one behind a bulkhead (i.e. behind the row often given to families - we were lucky to have a quiet family in front who slept as well as we did). Passengers on those rows generally do not recline their seats so much due to the extra space in front of them consequently we in turn did not feel so trapped in our seats as passengers further back may have done - our seats did not recline as much as some on other aircraft but we did not find this a problem. Worth mentioning that the food was excellent too!",Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
1,the most uncomfortable seat,Eva Zetterqvist,France,21st February 2015,,We flew CDG to SGL and then EZE to CDG the same torture unbelievable. This was unfortunately the most uncomfortable seat I sat in on a long haul flight. The seat looks good on the website when first looking at it. Air France makes its Premium Economy a real additional class. There are fewer seats per row. The seat is designed so that you have real isolated private space. You also have quite a lot legroom. Unfortunately the design of the seat itself is an outright disaster. The seat area itself is way too short even for short people. The seat hardly reclines at all. The footrest leaves your feet in an awkward cramped position if you do not happen to be extremely short - shorter than 160 cm like me. However not using the footrest will have your feet dangling in mid air. There is a leg rest that you can swing out but since the seat is too short it will hardly support anything. The seat is a disaster or an overnight long haul flight. Air France should feel ashamed charging extra for these seats. And it is not peanuts for us it was almost the double compared to Economy class fare.,Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-300ER,2x4x2
6,decent legroom but very uncomfortable,Mark Ledwick,United Kingdom,7th February 2015,,"Decent legroom but very uncomfortable. I had high hopes with it being my first flight on the A380 and it being a large modern aircraft. The recline was almost non-existent. Also I really couldn't understand how the tv screen could be so badly designed. I'm an average height guy around 5'10"" but couldn't see the screen properly when the seat in front wasn't reclined. Anyone shorter would see nothing. Who designed these things?",Air France ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
2,the most uncomfortable seat,Karl Banke,Germany,2nd February 2015,,This was unfortunately the most uncomfortable seat that I ever sat in on any long haul flight. The seat looks very good on the website as well as when first looking at it for real. Air France makes its Premium Economy a real additional class. There are fewer seats per row (2x3x2 as opposed to 2x4x2) and the Video Screen is much larger. There are better headphones than in Economy and the seat is designed so that you have real isolated private space. You also have quite a lot legroom. Unfortunately the design of the seat itself is an outright disaster. The seat area itself is way too short even for normal sized people. The seat does hardly recline at all. The footrest leaves your feet in an awkward cramped position if you do not happen to be very small. However not using the footrest will have your feat dangling in mid air. There is a leg rest that you can swing out but since the seat is to short it will hardly support anything. The whole seat design feels strangely like a business class seat for small children. Because of the legroom the good entertainment system and the private space this seat is probably an option for a day flight where seating comfort does not matter much. For an overnight long haul it is just a disaster.,Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A340,2x3x2
1,almost no recline or legroom,J Kwaak,South Korea,2nd February 2015,,Seat number 30A the last row of this particular section meaning almost no recline or legroom. A very old upholstery and more uncomfortable than other European carriers and Asian airlines. I had booked another seat during booking.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
10,was able to sleep comfortably,Y Kinsey,United States,27th January 2015,,"I flew in Premium Economy from LAX to CDG. I agree that the recline on these seats is not great but the width of the seat and the fact that no one reclines their seat into your lap was worth the extra money. I was able to sleep comfortably for the majority of the flight. My husband is 5""10 and was able to stretch out and sleep comfortably in the seat. The service was great. Flight attendants were attentive but not bothersome. We were on the upper deck which felt cozy with easy access to the snack bar and bathrooms. Food and wine with dinner was good. Breakfast was satisfactory also. Also enjoyed not having to wake my spouse in order to get into the aisle. Would definitely fly Air France premium economy again.",Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2
6,was much too slim,S Fleischer,Germany,19th November 2014,,I flew with TXL-CDG and the flight was okay. Non reclinable seat was ok but it was much too slim which means that I was able to feel on my back when the person behind me flods up the table. So when you are having bad luck and the person behind you is very tall you will feel knees in your back.,Air France ,Economy Class,AIRBIS A318,3x3
1,Thoroughly disappointed,Ovidia Wang,Malaysia,19th November 2014,,The PTV screen is not even aligned to my seat. Water is almost never served even when asked for a glass of water the request seems to be forgotten. Return flight got canceled thanks to the famous Air France strike with no accessible customer service to follow up with and we have not heard back from them on a refund even though we have written to them. First and last time flying with them. Thoroughly disappointed. Very uncomfortable seats as well.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
3,legroom is horrible,Stephen Frietch,United States,19th November 2014,,Legroom is horrible the worst ever for international 7 hour flight. Will not fly Air France again.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200,3x4x3
3,the worst seats ever,Frank Hokins,United States,6th August 2014,,We tried these seats for the first time flying CDG-ATL. Big mistake and we can say these are the worst seats ever. There is no recline and the seats are rock hard. Service and food is the same as regular economy.,Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-200,2x4x2
10,the most uncomfortable seats,Linda Weiss,United States,2nd August 2014,,These were the most uncomfortable seats we have sat in. I am horrified that I paid close to $1000.00 extra for 1 way to be this uncomfortable. I challenge the Air France executives and design engineers to travel 10 hours in these seats it was literally equivalent to torture.,Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
10,could not have been happier,Robert Mayo,United States,30th July 2014,,Seat 81L. This is an exit row had more space than a Business Class seat. AF has allowed me to book a seat prior to the flight being opened for online check in. Beverage & meal services were outstanding considering the class of service. Could not have been happier or more comfortable on this 10.5hr flight: LAX-CDG.,Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2
3,very limited recline,Chris Pleatsikas,United States,25th July 2014,,The hard shell seats were very uncomfortable with very limited recline. In addition the premium economy cabin was in very poor condition with obvious wear and tear that compromised some seat functions (such as the leg rest). The 8-across seating meant the seats were very narrow -- virtually the same width as the economy class cabin. In addition on two separate long-haul flights one of the two toilets was not working.,Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 777,2x3x2
2,customer service was non-existent,S Reed,United States,24th July 2014,,Not close to worth the added expense. As noted in other posts the seats are rock-hard and the recline feature is either not functioning or awkward and uncomfortable. On both A380 and 777 they looked good from a distance but showed incredible wear and inattention to maintenance. In a word shabby. Customer service was nonexistent as to seat selection and my wife and I were arbitrarily separated on both LAX-CDG and return. No one could do anything about it despite requests weeks before the flights days before flights or at check-in. The only real benefit was the priority boarding but I'd rather save my money and upgrade to business. This is no alternative.,Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A380,2x3x2
3,the worst seat I've ever experienced,Erik Jacobsen,France,24th July 2014,,I flew with Air France from San Francisco to Paris. The premium economy seat on this flight is the worst seat I've ever experienced. No recline the seat just drops a few inches when you push the recline button. Also the seat is hard as a rock; it's more comfortable to sit on a park-bench. To add insult to injury the entertainment-screen did not work.,Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 777,2x3x2
3,impossible to adjust the seat,K Roberts,United States,24th July 2014,,"The seat did not actually recline it sort of slid down and the front edge of the bottom seat cushion moved forward. However it didn't reach a position which was comfortable. The ""footrest"" was terrible it was really a ""legrest"" that only extended about 2/3 the way from my knees to my ankles but all it did was press against my calves and cut off the circulation. It was also difficult to put back had to press hard against it with my legs while pushing a button on the inside arm of the seat. The table which was stored in the seat arm did not slide forward enough to provide room between it and my stomach - I'm not particularly large so I don't know how someone who is heavier would even manage to use the table. I had to have the seat completely in the upright position to be able to use the table at all and it was rather awkward trying to eat with it that close. Also the seat adjustment buttons are right under where the table hinges so it's essentially impossible to adjust the seat when the table is out. We were sitting in the first row on the right side of the plane so had lots of legroom; I give the normal seats 4 of 5 based on my observation but I'm not very tall so don't need a lot of legroom. The video screen was in the other arm of the seat position when out was OK but not great a little low and of course off center.",Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A380,2x3x2
2,hardly any recline,Max Gordon,Germany,11th March 2014,,"Adequate width. Hardly any recline. Seat bsase moves forward slightly and back rest moves with it to provide a minimum but not a comfortable amount. Lower part of seat doubles as a rest for upper legs (activated by button on seat). Base of seat in front has foot rest. However the seats are so close together than when the seat is in the reclined position and the leg rest raised it is impossible- even to rest feet on for rest as it is too close. I am of short stature and I was unable to sit comfortably for this reason. I found it necessary either to have my feet supported which led to fatigue in the upper legs or to have my upper legs supported meaning that my feet were ""dangling"". Sleep was possible but only just. Lights from other passenger´ seats and screens is very intrusive and impedes sleep. Everything is very close together giving no sense of privacy. The seat rows are so close that anyone sitting away from the aisle can only exit if the passenger on the aisle seat moves which is inconvenient for all. Unlike other reviewers I did not suffer any back pain or other serious discomfort but did not feel rested. The seat I had originally been assigned to was broken- the lower left rest disengaged and rose immediately I sat down - the latching mechanism was defective. This problem could not be sorted out before departure. However I was able to move to the next seat in the row. If this had not been the case then I suspect I would not have been allowed to use the seat during take off and landing since I could not sit in the ""upright"" position. Also the raised footrest would have impeded exit of the passenger sitting in the middle seat posing a safety hazard. The seats appeared to be superior to the economy seats as far as the width was concerned. However I do not consider the extra cost to be justified. The price differential compared to what is on offer is far higher than e.g. from economy to business.",Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-300ER,2x4x2
1,service was almost non-existent,I Maxted,Hong Kong,3rd March 2014,,After 40 years of intensive international travel I can safely say that these are the worst seats I have ever had the misfortune to occupy. In addition to which the service was almost non-existent and definitely not worth the premium price over a regular Y Class seat.,Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-300ER,2x3x2
3,seats are hard,C Wajsberg,Israel,10th January 2014,,Seat 91k is a seat plus beside the more available legroom I do not know what the plus stands for. Seats are hard to hard actually and narrow but this is what you get in coach class.,Air France ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2
1,very little leg room,A Bahja,United Kingdom,6th January 2014,,11 hour flight from Paris to Mauritius the seats were rock hard and very little leg room to move about in. IFE system was very bad and broken. The stewardess couldn't fix my screen so I had to basically spend 10 hours not being able to sleep or entertain myself.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
1,seats were hard narrow and very short,Julie Van,Australia,3rd January 2014,,The seats were hard narrow and very short which cut off circulation we were crammed into centre positions our knees hit the seat in front and the person next to me who was a little larger spread across my shoulder and had monopoly of the tiny hard little arm rest. The person in front threw back their seat and when we complained at mealtime we were told he was asleep and would we please leave him be. On arrival after a 13 hour trip over night with no sleep and the agony of such confinement our feet and ankles were swollen and we felt absolutely battered. Unfortunately we had flown to Paris 4 weeks before and it was exactly the same for this our return journey so we knew what we could expect.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
5,seats are narrow and require more padding,S Crusi,Australia,3rd January 2014,,Shanghai-Paris and return - seats are narrow and require more padding. Both flights- tried looking cabins (showing wear & tear) and very poor IFE. I was quite surprised that Air France would operate these tried looking B777 on the Shanghai route. Cabin service good food average. IFE quality was very poor considering competition. I recommend Air France take a note of CX cabin revamp program and IFE system. I expected the fine French experience but did not get it.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
10,we were totally satisfied,N Jewell,United States,3rd January 2014,,I am used to business class seats with flat bed for overnight but these are Great seats for daytime (we departed 4:30 pm JFK to Paris arriving midnight our biological time and returned during the day) Crew very attentive meals quite good my 6'2'' husband was pleasantly surprised quiet section curtained off from crowded economy section. Had seen previously negative reviews but we were totally satisfied and felt it is worth the extra cost.,Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A330,2x3x2
1,very disappointing once you're seated,A Artus,United Kingdom,3rd January 2014,,Good looking seats but very disappointing once you're seated. The comfort is horrible as they are very hard recline is minimal and an 8 hour flight is a torture.,Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A340,2x4x2
2,seats are designed for tiny petite people,M Whittal,South Africa,3rd January 2014,,I am tall and have a large frame these seats are designed for tiny petite people. No Leg room very narrow and hard! Air France charges too much for an upgrade to a premium economy seat (seats behind bulkhead and galleys) I will not travel on this aircraft again!,Air France ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
4,these are better than economy seats,D Christa,United States,3rd January 2014,,Let's start with the fact that these are better than economy seats. Your own mini-section the shell feature PTV better service are all perks. The downside is the padding…- it is like sitting on a board. I brought an extra pillow to sit on but it didn't help that much. Secondly is the recline. It's odd and doesn't really recline - it slides forward. With that said take a look at the cabin behind to your rear and see how comfortable they look.,Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2
1,disgraceful for a flag carrier,A Price,France,20th April 2013,,One of the middle seats disgraceful for a flag carrier. Almost as bad as Emirates 777 - the only difference is the footrest on AF. Never again.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
5,intimate in size but spacious,G Shaw,United States,24th February 2013,,The Premier Voyageur cabin is intimate in size but spacious. While the seats in this class are far superior to those in coach class there are drawbacks. The fixed seat shell is marvelous as passengers do not encroach into other passengers' space but the recline mechanism could be improved to provide greater comfort. I fly the LAX-CDG route annually and it is annoying that on every trip the passenger sitting behind me kept their window shades open or kept their reading light on throughout the flight. There should be a period during the flight when passengers should be able to sleep. The service as always (at least in my experience flying AF) is superior. The food can be questionable but I will likely order the special meals for my next trip which appear to be superior to the standard meals offered.,Air France ,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2
5,hard narrow and most uncomfortable,R North,United Kingdom,15th February 2013,,Flight from Paris to Hong Kong. The seats were hard narrow and most uncomfortable even for a short flight 12 hours was torture!!,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
6,a sensation of space,Rodolphe Paccard,France,15th February 2013,,CDG-MEX seat 53K. It's in the narrower part of the aircraft at the rear so there are only 2 seats instead of 3 on the windows side. IFE box was under the seat in front of me but to I was not too bothered by it. The seat is away from the cabin wall and this gives you several windows and a sensation of space. You get your own storage space between the seat and the wall which can also serve as a table. Although it will be shared with the person behind you. Getting things in and out of it means removing anything sitting on top. The IFE was okay selection of programs was fair. However to select anything on the screen you had to press hard which makes you shake the seat in front of you. I had to endure that from the lady behind me. Food and drink service was very good for Economy.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3
5,seats have no padding,Bob Turner,United States,22nd January 2013,,"Air France Premium Economy. Downside a bit expensive upgrade no toilets but they didn't seem to object to us using first class toilets. Those who put down these seats have not sat in Air France economy - which is horrible. I am only 5'6"" but the economy seats have no padding.",Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 777,2x4x2
4,seats barely reclined at all,C Matlack,France,10th January 2013,,I traveled in the lower-level economy cabin in the last row of the cabin. The seats barely reclined at all. I complained to the hostess as this was an overnight transatlantic flight. She informed me that all seats in the economy cabin had the same pitch. Needless to say I spent a very uncomfortable night.,Air France ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
1,to me it was torture,D Wheeler,New Zealand,24th December 2012,,Flew AF economy HK to Paris. Never again! I'm not a small person at 6ft tall and 120kg and to me it was torture. I never got comfortable in all 13 hours 40 minutes of flying. Very narrow seat poor recline and 2 empty seats next to me I could not take advantage of because the armrests were fixed! The TV was quite blurry too.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
1,do not believe the hype,R Le Goff,Australia,24th December 2012,,We paid a lot to travel Voyageur class which is Air France's version of Premium Economy. Do not believe the video on the AF website and do not believe the hype. The seats are narrow and have been designed so badly that you have no chance of a restful flight. You just slide down and your knees bang into the seat in front. You get plastic cutlery and cups and same food as economy. Do not pay for this class of fare. There is very little difference to their AF economy class. The service is the same non-existent. Makes me ashamed to hold a French passport. Never again.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2
1,this seat was so narrow,D Wheeler,United States,17th September 2012,,I literally thought it was a joke - that's how uncomfortable this seat (and hence the entire trip) was. I'm not exactly skinny but neither am I obese yet this seat was so narrow it cut off circulation to my thighs. To make matters worse my shoulders and upper arms kept bumping up against the passenger to my right (I was in an aisle seat) to the point where I finally had to get up and pace around the plane to relieve the discomfort. Throughout the entire trip from Miami to Paris I was lucky if I was able to sleep for 20 minutes. I arrived at my destination in the Middle East feeling like I'd been run over by a truck.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
1,recline is very limited,Donald Hamilton,United Kingdom,17th September 2012,,"In their Premium Voyageur cabin Air France has achieved the remarkable feat of making providing a seat which is uncomfortable for both my wife (5'6"" and of medium build) and myself (6'4"" and of heavier build). They are hard. The recline is very limited when it works and the fixed head rest is too low to support the head of anyone with any height. These problems were compounded by the failure to carry extension belts which fit the short seat-belts fitted on the second and third of the three rows (I was able to use the belt on the A319 on the connecting flight without difficulty). I therefore had to be transferred to the front row. This has a bulkhead which diminishes the value of the extra leg-room when the seat is upright: when I tried to use the (limited) recline  an extension came out which pinned my feet to the bulkhead. In short this cabin is over-priced offering less than the preferred seats in the Air Canada Economy cabin",Air France ,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-200ER,2x4x2
3,seats narrow and hard ,B Knight,Australia,22nd October 2011,,AF seats narrow and hard and it was very difficult to get comfortable. Also I have short legs and the absence of a footrest is a real problem - I had to place cushions on the floor & place my feet on them to ensure adequate circulation in my legs. My impression from 6 SIN-CDG legs is that the planes need a cabin refit with more comfortable seats. On the other hand I would rate AF ahead of Qantas's mediocre international economy offerings.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x3x3
3,seat was spacious,R Kivett,United Kingdom,22nd October 2011,,I flew in the A380 going from CDG to IAD and then came back in the A330 ORD to CDG. The 380 seat was spacious with a large screen while the A330 was cramped and had the tiniest of screens. I gave such a poor rating for the recline due to when the person reclines completely in front you can't eat easily get out of your seat see the TV screen very well or feel like you can breathe. I didn't feel comfortable putting my seat all way back in consideration of the person behind. The seats also lead to people behind pulling on your seat when they try and get up and down from these cramped positions. I will try and avoid this aircraft in the future on AF.,Air France ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
3,the narrowest seat I have ever sat in,R Ireland,United Kingdom,22nd October 2011,,11hr flight from Paris Orly to La Reunion. By far the narrowest seat I have ever sat in. I think it was even narrower than the seats on Ryanair which is a budget airline. Legs were pressed right into back of the seat in front and when they reclined it was game over. Never again. It is strange as I use Air France on European flights as well and the seats on the smaller aircraft are wider and with more legroom!,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
1,had minimum leg room,A Dewar,Australia,19th September 2011,,I was seated 24K. 3 seats jammed in behind a row of 2 seats. 24J had minimum leg room and the large gentleman had to sit at an angle with legs in the aisle and third of his upper body in my area. Worst flight of my life.,Air France ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
5,very uncomfortable flight,Suzanne Cooper,Canada,4th September 2011,,Very uncomfortable flight; I wouldn't travel on Air France again. With the seats in front inclined it was impossible to get out of the seats. All and all I wouldn't choose Air France again.,Air France ,Economy Class,A340-300,2x4x2
1,the smallest airline seat,Juliet Brumlik,United States,28th July 2011,,"I am a small person 5'3"" and 110 pounds. For me my seat was the smallest airline seat I've ever seen. Eleven and a half hours of misery.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
1,cramped seating,Joe English,Ireland,28th July 2011,,Aisle seat at emergency exit so legroom not a problem. Seat is the narrowest I have ever sat on - perhaps it is slightly narrower than all the other economy seats to incorporate the tray table in the armrest? Also the hardest seat I ever experienced. How an airline can expect anyone to sit on this hard seat for twelve hours is beyond me. Given cramped seating and the harness of the seat I will never choose Air France for intercontinental travel again.,Air France ,Economy Class,B777-300 / B777-200,3x4x3
1,very cramped cabin,M Matsuda,United Kingdom,5th April 2011,,CDG to HKG with B777-300 and HKG to CDG with B777-200. Economy class on the day to HKG from CDG was full. Very cramped cabin with 3x4x3 configuration. The seat on the aircraft was like wooden bench. I felt that the seat on B777-200 on the way back to CDG was a bit better. Has AF improved the seat? Either way their economy seat is far from satisfactory. Also on the way back to CDG they ran out of food available between first and second meal. If you take a long haul flight with AF make sure that you take some food with you just like the time you take a budget airline.,Air France ,Economy Class,B777-300 / B777-200,3x4x3
3,one of the worst experiences,Massimo Zanasi,Finland,22nd November 2010,,CDG-LIS on A320. Very little legroom for a 6.2 ft. tall. One of the worst experiences compared to most European airlines.,Air France ,Economy Class,A320,3x3
1,seats so miserably uncomfortable,Debra Angeloff,United States,26th October 2010,,I was stunned to find the seats so miserably uncomfortable for an intercontinental flight. The seats were extremely narrow short and very hard with very little leg room. It became impossible for me to get comfortable in any way to be able to relieve pressure on my legs or sleep on my flight. There was absolutely zero room for anyone to get out of his/her seat to go to the restroom without having the entire row get up as well to let them out. I will never fly with Air France again because of this level of discomfort.,Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,2x4x2
8,plenty of room good comfort,John Whiting,United Kingdom,22nd October 2010,,Premium economy Paris-Osaka for 11 hours. I sat at the front of the premium economy cabin. Pros- more legroom than the standard premium economy seats. Cons the tray tables are in the arms and not as large as the normal seats which makes working on a laptop a little less convenient. Overall I would certainly choose this seat again. I had a day flight both ways so did not try to sleep. Seat was comfortable for the duration and I did not find it too hard. As I was working most of the flight I didn't use the recline much but it seemed OK. The laptop power is standard 240V and either a standard French type or US plug will fit. It is limited in power and my laptop which is fairly low power would only work if the battery was taken out. That said the supply never faltered. Video was good with a reasonable large screen (although nobody could describe it as pin sharp) and a good choice of current films and TV shows. The earphones are OK but I used my own which plugged into a single 3.5mm socket so there was no need for an adapter. Service was OK not bad but not exceptional and the food was standard economy fare OK but nothing to get excited about. Overall a very pleasant flight and I don't think that I would have had much of a better flight in business class (but I wasn't trying to sleep). Overall plenty of room good comfort and easy boarding disembarking. Highly recommended.,Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-200ER,2x4x2
5,hard shell seat gives feeling of extra space,A Bruce,United Kingdom,21st September 2010,,"Flew the new AF Premium economy product. Pros: hard shell seat gives feeling of extra space and good AV (with noise reducing headphones and slot for own 'phones). Socket for laptop also handy tho' not used by me. Seat reclines (actually it ""declines"" in its shell) enough to aid sleep. Ticket class enables you to access AF lounge at CDG for a fee. The seat is very thin and very uncomfortable over a long flight. I bought a cushion in SCL for the return route but still had ""numb bum"". This detracts heavily from an otherwise good product. Please AF put some more padding in the seat cushion!",Air France ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-200,2x4x2
1,should think about passenger comfort,Tarik Tamzali,France,20th January 2010,,Entertainment is excellent. But the seat configuration on B777-300 at 3x4x3 makes it hard to survive after a 11 hours flight. AF should definitely think about passenger comfort. I will never board those 777 again and I will prefer to choose another airline than AF on my next long haul flights to HKG and ICN.,Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
1,seat wouldn't recline very far,Terence Ho,Hong Kong,4th December 2009,,12 hours from Hong Kong to Paris was awful - my seat wouldn't recline very far as I was in front of the toilet - the seat width was the worst ever as was the pitch (especially when reclining). 3x4x3 isn't the normal seating configuration on a 777 which explains why it was so cramped even for someone as short as I am.,Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
1,very cramped seats,Judith Sriram,United States,14th October 2009,,"This BOS-CDG flight was the worst transatlantic flight I've ever taken. Very cramped seats I'm small (5'2"") not obese and could barely fit into it. When person next to me pressed on arm rest it pinced my thigh enough to make me jump once or twice. Seat so cramped that I could hardly move around to relieve pressure on legs. Will never take this particular flight again.",Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 747-400,3x4x3
2,squeezing into the seat was incredibly difficult,John Reay,United Kingdom,31st August 2009,,I was quite surprised at just how bad the seating was aboard our Air France 747. I consider myself to be of average build and height and fairly fit yet squeezing into the seat was incredibly difficult. There was approximately one inch of space between my knees and the seat in front far less than the majority of short-haul flights I make. Extricating myself from the seat to get to the bathroom involved disturbing the two people sat next to me who were forced to get out of their seat and pile into the galley area because I wanted to leave. After the problems I faced when I first attempt to get out of my seat I gave in and remained stationary for the remainder of the flight. I dread to think how unpleasant the flight would have been if I was over 6 feet or weighed more than average. I have since recommended that all of my friends and colleagues avoid Air France at all costs.,Air France ,Economy Class,Boeing 747-400,3x4x3
1,like sitting on a plastic chair,M Matsuda,United Kingdom,2nd March 2009,,CDG-Tokyo. It was the worst flight in my life. The seat was hard enough to feel like sitting on a plastic chair. My back was very painful after a 12hr flight. I chose the flight because it was the first time to fly with them and was the only flight departing Tokyo in late evening. I never fly their B777-300ER 3x4x3 layout aircraft again.,Air France ,Economy Class,B777-300ER,3x4x3
1,way too narrow seating,Mike Hoder,Germany,1st March 2009,,Perfect flight but way too narrow seating in eco/tempo. No chance to get a sleep under these conditions. Not recommended.,Air France ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
7,much better seating,Mike Hoder,Germany,1st March 2009,,CDG-JFK. Much better seating compared to Air France 777 models. I recommend choosing the 330 if possible.,Air France ,Economy Class,A330-200,2x4x2
1,narrowest Y seat I've ever experienced,Benno Bauer,Austria,7th February 2009,,CDG to Tokyo - the narrowest Y seat I've ever experienced. Took the flight because it was cheap turned out to be a mistake. Never ever want to fly on such a cramped plane again horrible.,Air France ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
5,very tight seat pitch,D Vanden Abeele,Belgium,10th December 2008,,Very tight seat pitch for long haul travel and not recommended at all. If in economy try to obtain an exit row seat or seat 31K.,Air France ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
1,seats felt very cramped,Rodney White,United States,17th November 2008,,"Seats felt very cramped - worst I've ever experienced. Who is the genius that decided to put in new thickly padded and sculpted seats (which push you closer to the seat in front) with the most recline I've ever seen in Economy but kept the seat pitch at 31-32""? When the seat in front reclined the video screen was 8"" in front of my face and it is impossible to reach the floor or stand up for that matter. It is ridiculously tight unless you are under 5'6"".",Air France ,Economy Class,A340,2x4x2
1,would not recommend these seats,Stanley Gershbein,United States,29th September 2008,,Not only would I not recommend these seats I will never fly on Air France again. I have never seen seats so close together. There was no leg room and I'm not a large person. As for the recline - the head of the passenger in front of me was practically in my lap.,Air France ,Economy Class,B747-400,3x4x3
8,leg room was adequate,David Liu,Singapore,5th June 2020,0," Boeing 787-10 leg room was adequate, it shouldn’t be a worry for medium-haul flights like this (SQ878). The screen size was good, it was difficult for you and your neighbor to see each other’s screens, giving you a decent amount of privacy. The 3-3-3 configuration makes it easy to access the aisles (with the exception of window seats) compared to most other wide body airliner. Power sockets are available to keep your devices charged. A cup holder is also present which was a nice touch as you no longer need to worry about your drink spilling over and onto your seat.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-10,3-3-3
4,the seat feels very narrow,Sahil Aggarwal,Australia,12th February 2020,1," The Boeing 787-10 legroom is fine, but the seat feels very narrow and is uncomfortable. The A350 seats which I flew earlier were much better. Not sure if I would want to fly on Singapore Airlines Boeing 787 again.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-10,3x3x3
4,completely disappointed,K Martin,Australia,7th February 2020,1," We flew Singapore to LAX Premium Economy and were completely disappointed. The seats had recline and footrests alright but were so narrow we were both very uncomfortable all night. Food was awful (stale buns) Eg Pasta shrimp salad had no dressing, vegetables were stewed beyond recognition . Service was brusque to the point of being rude. Icecream tub was almost thrown at me in the haste to get service done quickly . No welcome drink. Requests for water were forgotten. We have in the past had the pleasure of travelling premium economy Air NZ and there is NO comparison. Don’t know what happened to Singapore Airlines supposed excellence for service. Their Premium Economy offering was fairly price competitive (albeit our first leg from Australia was only offered in economy), however I think they make this happen by essentially providing economy level meals (No amenities pack ). The poor service is a total shock. Have they lost their mojo?",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A350-900,2x4x2
6,recline was pretty good,A Kasim,Indonesia,2nd February 2020,1, The Boeing 777-300 leg room was sufficient leads to good. The recline was pretty good. The cup holder for mine was broken so I should’ve put it on the pocket in front of my seat,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
1,kept having to move my legs,Hannah Bousfield,Australia,21st January 2020,0, Booked an extra leg room seat on this flight from Singapore to Melbourne.  I couldn’t sleep as my seat was in an aisle and I kept having to move my legs for the staff to go to the kitchen and for people to get to the toilet. Do not book this seat (49C) or 49A for that matter as the cabin door blocks the majority of your leg room. The plane feels super cramped and old. If you want an extra leg room seat that is actually an extra leg room seat and not in a walkway then book the A380.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
10,Leg room was fantastic,Hannah Bousfield,Australia,21st January 2020,0, This was the best flight I’ve ever taken. Leg room was fantastic as were the staff. The layout of the plane makes it feel spacious. Genuinely the easiest 13 hours I’ve ever had on a plane. The only issue I had was that my seat didn’t recline far.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380-800,3x4x3
1,worst premium economy,N Beale,Australia,21st January 2020,1," The worst premium economy for the price. Don’t waste your money. Treated like economy passengers with same food, service and access to toilets. Seats didn’t recline very far and leg rests barely supported legs. A very uncomfortable experience. TV screen is very large but that is the only good thing. ",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A350,2x4x2
10,a very comfortable seat,Ethan Phua,Singapore,2nd December 2019,1," Singapore Airlines 2015 version of the Economy seat is a very comfortable seat. It has a touchscreen and a controller with a small touchscreen on it as well. The seat also features a comfortable legrest, an adjustable headrest, many seatback compartment pockets convenient for storing small things, as well as a cup holder. The tray table was large, practical, and even had a mirror as a nice touch. Legroom was excellent and recline was sufficient. With many airlines switching to a 3-4-3 configuration on the Boeing 777-300ER, it is good that Singapore Airlines still retains a 3-3-3 configuration.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x3x3
2,the most narrow seats,T Heale,Singapore,7th October 2019,,"Torture for anybody over 185cm in height. Had my worst eco trip ever. The new Eco seats in SQ economy on their A350 are absolutely terrible. Seat pitch is on par with any low cost budget carrier. Bearable for 2hours but definetely not medium or longhaul. Absolutely no legspace and the most narrow seats I have sat in. Thats the stadard seats, the additional legroom seats against a surcharge are fine legspace wise but even more narrower as the tray folds out of the armrest and the compartment takes up space. Also end up with a weird seating position when the screen is folded under the seat as also this protrudes. Really disappointing and no idea who at SQ came up with these seat designs but seems from groundstaff and cabin crew feedback that this is a common complaint. If you have to fly Eco and are on the tall or wide side then suggest other carriers as this was definitely my last SQ Eco flight.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A350-900,3x3x3
3,The padding is also hard,K Pataporn,Thailand,7th July 2019,1," I normally do not have any problem with airlines configuring their Boeing 787-10 with a 3-3-3 configuration, however Singapore Airlines managed to screw it up big time! How did this seat become so narrow? Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, All Nippon and others all have their 787s configured in a 3-3-3 configuration, but the seat width on those planes are wide enough for my shoulders, and hence a comfortable flight. The padding is also hard, yet the seat is very thick. The seat base is quite small, and you may sometimes just fall off the seat. There is no remote for the TV screen, it was responsive except for one incident. One thing I don't understand is that there is a camera in the tv screen.  The other seat functions are good, legroom is fine but the seat has set a bad taste for me and future flights on Singapore Airlines. Hope they can improve in the future or change their seat entirely. This was only a two hour flight to Bangkok. I can't imagine what it would be like on a red-eye flight to Japan!",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-10,3x3x3
10,best flying experience,William Huddy,United States,27th May 2019,1," On our flight from SIN-HKG (SG856), my wife and had the best flying experience we have ever had. We just happened to be celebrating our wedding anniversary. The flight crew on the upper deck of the A380 was incredible! From the warm welcome entering the aircraft to the personalized greeting at our seats, the crew made us feel incredibly comfortable. We booked seats 96D/F. They were incredibly comfortable in the upright and lounging positions, and when both seats are in the “full flat” position, they turn into a double bed. Although we were on a 4 hours day time flight, it was fun being able to lay next to my wife. The IFE system was great. The monitor was large and the resolution was great. The noise cancelling head phones worked well and were pretty comfortable. We both took advantage of the “Book the Cook” items for our lunch (she had the ribeye steak and I had the Lobster Thermidor) and there were both delicious. After lunch we were talking with the flight attendants and our anniversary came up during our conversation. About 5 minutes later a group of flight attendants were at our seats. They gave us a couple of Singapore Air A380 teddy bear, a glass of champagne and one of them was carrying a ukulele (they knew we were from Hawaii). They proceeded to sing a Happy Anniversary song to us, this was an incredible surprise and treat. We’d like to send our heart felt thanks to the flight attendants",Singapore Airlines ,Business Class,A380-800,1x2x1
4,seats on the A350 are so narrow,E Charles,Australia,22nd May 2019,1," Singapore Airlines have made a big mistake if you are a business class traveller like myself. The seats on the new A350 are so narrow there is almost a feeling of claustrophobia about them and to say they are uncomfortable is an understatement! Not only are these seats narrow they have no storage and there is essentially no back recline! To move or recline the back of your seat you have to move the whole seat forward when pressing recline button. Essentially you have to start the lie flat position which takes the whole seat forward rather than just the back rest. My trip last year Adelaide to London on the 777 was so ridiculous with the leg and recline positions I actually considered cancelling my return trip except for the fact that I managed to change my seat to the centre aisle bulkhead seat which was a little better, not so with the A350. This is a disaster.",Singapore Airlines ,Business Class,A350,1x2x1
9,seats very comfortable,Grahame Williams,Australia,30th April 2019,1," Seat 33A on A350-900, last row, window. Small cabin, well positioned, seats very comfortable with all tech features and great IFE choices. Food and drinks service started in this cabin. Drink portions too small (tea/coffee), nearest toilets meant a walk through the cabin behind us. Toilet floors dirty and wet.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A350-900,2x4x2
3,worst seats in Premium Economy,G Fisk,Australia,28th April 2019,1," Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines is usually a pleasant experience but my recent flight on SQ221, an A380-800, was not the case. Specifically seats 32H and 32K should be avoided. These seats must be the worst seats in Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines. Firstly, there is no luggage space at all for passengers in seats 31H and 31K and if the board first they take up the limited luggage space for the passengers seated behind them. Secondly, the passengers in seats 32H and 32K have a cabinet adjacent to their seats which is used by cabin staff to store various sundry items, which the cabin staff access constantly throughout the flight. Not only does this mean the cabin staff interrupt the passenger in seat 32H constantly throughout the flight they often stick their bottoms in the face of the passenger as they do so.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A380-800,2x4x2
5,not impressed with the design,E Barly,China,2nd March 2019,1," I flew SQ833 and SQ255, Shanghai to Brisbane via Singapore on 27/28 February. On these journeys and on previous SQ journeys, I've flown Premium Economy. I am not at all impressed with the design of the seats. They're not particularly comfortable. Leg room could be OK with ingenuity. The folding trays slotted between the seats often cause all sorts of inconvenience to passengers and staff since they have to be stowed ""just so"" or they don't stow without awkwardness and delay. The lid covering the trays has no obvious lifting point or slot or button or ... On the 380 there were two buttons below the cover that had nothing to do with the cover but which seemed that they might do. I pressed one. A sort of thigh/leg support appeared. It was not wanted. I pressed retract. Nothing happened so there we were stuck with a half-projected support for the rest of the flight. Then there's the point for insertion of the head phone plugs - to the side and behind the passenger. A meal arrives, the tray has to be extracted and later retracted. And then there's a nice mix up of headphones cable , tray table, tray and confused passenger. Then there's the prissy little ""pocket"" on the back of the seat in front that may need to contain a laptop, an ipad, a documents gag, the free bottle of water and some medications. Well, well. Good luck with that - after a sick bag, a Kris world magazine, a Kris Flyer magazine, an emergency procedures card all have prior place. The floor has then to make do for head phone cover, amenities bag and newspapers and magazines that the profligate passenger may have had the lack of foresight to bring. Then try finding the medications with cabin lights out at 4 am without disturbing the sleeping neighbour by turning on the overhead light. All is darkness. No doubt SIA paid millions for this design. Maybe they were taken by the ominous black and orange colour scheme, one that in the world of nature does not generally bode well.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A350,2x4x2
8,seats were very comfortable,Teng Yong Khoo,Malaysia,19th February 2019,1, The A350 of Singapore Airlines is generally amazing. The seats were very comfortable and the TV screen view was generally good. ,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A350,3x3x3
6,my ratings have gone down,Teng Yong Khoo,Malaysia,19th February 2019,1, The aircraft is an A330 and because this an older aircraft many of my ratings have gone down compared to the A350. The seat legroom can be better and also the seat recline.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
10,Comfy seat with spacious legroom,S Chan,Malaysia,10th February 2019,1, Comfy seat with spacious legroom for someone who is 180cm tall. Love the cup holder and foot rest. And a vanity mirror at the tray table. Singapore airlines really make it the best and pay into small details to entertain passengers' needs,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A350-900,3x3x3
10,Good airline still,C Han,Malaysia,27th December 2018,1," Attentive crew. Helpful, friendly and proactive with drinks in the mid of the flight. Meal services were very smooth. Though I can see that many people are complaining about this airline, I don't see any problem. Though the flight was departed behind the schedule, I don't blame them as I believe it was not their mistake and no people love to delay a plane and crew wanted to go home on time too. They still provide menu card and hot towels before take off and landing. Meals were good and inflight entertainment is great. Amenities in the lavatory are sufficient and all economy passengers received an amenity pack with socks and toothbrush in it. Good airline still. My all time favourite.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x3x3
3,seats are very shallow and flat,P Garten,United Kingdom,23rd November 2018,1," Having had an outbound journey with Singapore Airlines in business class, we came back in premium economy, and the difference could not be more stark! While the base spec of their premium economy offering appears on paper very similar to many others, we were very disappointed when comparing them to, for example, Virgin. The seats are among the most uncomfortable we had ever sat in, making the 13.5 hour flight to London from Singapore a real test of endurance. To put this into perspective, the economy seats we had on Singapore Airlines sister carrier Silk Air for an earlier connecting flight were exceptionally comfortable! The use of a solid centre divider between each pair of seats means you are hemmed in (they claim 19.5 inches width, but I think its more like 17!) and achieving any diagonal recline is very hard. The seats are also very shallow and flat, meaning that when reclining you start to slide off - not helped by a bizarre thigh support pop-out and ridiculous footrest, when don't work together well at all. The seat needs to be more bucket shaped to be in any way comortable, and a 2x3x2 format would help achieve a more premium feel. Legroom is also deceptively similar to economy. All in all, we were very disappointed, and given that at current prices, you can find upgrades to business class on LHR-SIN return for about 35-40% additional, we'd rather do that. We certainly won't fly Singapore Airlines premium economy again, but instead look to use business class and save on other areas of trips.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300ER,2x4x2
9,It has wider seats,Doug Dumpa,Philippines,23rd November 2018,1," The first time to fly on the A350-900 from Singapore to Munich. It has wider seats, wider tv monitor, more storage, has a socket for charging phones, comfortable headrest and with ergonomic design that your body seem to fit into the seat comfortably with extra space.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A350-900,3x3x3
3,"very uncomfortable, narrow",L Fan,Australia,5th November 2018,1," The premium economy class seats are very uncomfortable, narrow, pitch is not long and the reclining of 7 inches untrue. The seat may at best recline up to 5 inches only. The leg rest does not pop up sufficient to give any support. There were no dedicated toilets for Premium Economy.  Staff from Economy class served Premium Economy as well. You can expect the service you are getting.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A350-900,2x4x2
9,The A380 seats were comfy,B Nguyen,United States,30th September 2018,0," The A380 seats were comfy. It reclined back far enough so I wasn’t uncomfortable. The leg room was good for me (I am 5’2), might be a bit uncomfortable if you are way taller. There was a cushion on the top where the head lays, I loved that because I didn’t bring a neck pillow.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380-800,3x4x3
10,prevents disturbing the passenger,Doug Dumpa,Philippines,12th August 2018,1, The rows of the seats on the Boeing 787-10 are not aligned anymore and it prevents disturbing the passenger on an aisle seat by another passenger on the other row section. The first airline I’ve experienced having this kind of seat arrangement. Innovative.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-10,3x3
6,comfortable and clean,William Gilbert,United States,9th June 2018,1," Mumbai to Singapore. I was excited to be able to finally fly on an A380 and Singapore Airlines, and at the same time. When I was offered the option to upgrade at the airport (for a price) to Premium Economy I did so without hesitation. I found the A380 to be comfortable and clean. However I felt the cabin crew seemed to do just the minimum possible. I felt that nothing that wasn't offered to the Economy passenger was offered to our cabin. To their credit, when we arrived late for the connecting flight to LA the hotel and new boarding pass were ready and waiting.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A380,2x4x2
5,seat had not much recline,Teng Yong Khoo,Malaysia,29th May 2018,1," The A330 seat width was limited which makes it hard for me to put my personal belongings under the seat. The seat had not much recline in my personal view, but overall it is still an excellent airline with nice cabin crews and inflight entertainment.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330-300,2x4x2
4,we were very disappointed,Catherine Veele,Netherlands,3rd February 2018,0,"❎  Amsterdam to Singapore. Because of the long traveling we decided to spend extra money and chose to book the premium economy seats. We were looking forward to a comfortable flight in premium economy. However we were very disappointed. The seats are not that extra comfortable comparing to the economy seats, not much leg room, the leg rest not functional at all. We got the same food as the economy and the same service. Nothing special at all. But worst of all was the attitude of the crew. The were cranky and not friendly at all. I haven’t seen a smile of one of them. We asked for water and had to ask twice again, before we got some water. After the stop in Singapore we flew on with Air New Zealand, also premium economy, and we were suprised about the difference. A welcoming and friendly crew who offered us a drink at boarding. The seats were very comfortable, and the food was excellent. We had a very pleasant flight. In the past I was always happy to fly with Singapore airlines, but I think they are not that good anymore. I Will not book a flight with them anymore. I wonder why we had to pay so much more extra money for nothing special. Never again.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A350,2x4x2
9,The seats are comfortable,Adrian Suharto,Singapore,29th October 2017,," Three class configuration aircraft, I sat in Economy for the SIN-CGK route. This is a popular route, and I usually prefer to sit at the back (the configuration at the 2 last rows at the back are 2-3-2); where I get to get served first - and alight later. Yes, it would get a bit noisy at the back but for 1.5 hour trip with good inflight entertainment this is bearable. The seats are comfortable but entertainment system depends on the airline type; SQ uses some really old 777 for this route and in the past their entertainment system had issues. The older the plane, the lesser selections there are in the entertainment system; and the resolution of the screen also becomes not as clear.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x3x3
7,on par with other international carriers ,L Chen,United States,23rd September 2017,," In terms of seat pitch and seat width, Singapore Airlines premium economy seats are on par with other international carriers that offer a ""true"" premium economy product. It offers 38 inch of pitch and 18.5 inch of width. Do note that the seats on SQ's 777-300ER are one-inch narrower than the seats on its A380. Here are the pros and cons: Pro: (1) stylish seats with ample storage space; (2) the seat has both a leg-rest and footrest (foot bar) although the leg-rest is of limited use for people who are tall; (3) ability to pre-select meals via the Book the Cook option; (4) legendary Singapore Airlines service; and (5) extensive IFE selection with a large screen Cons: (1) seat recline is somewhat limited; (2) no dedicated lavatory in the PE cabin; (3) the large armrest seems to have reduce the seat width somewhat (but seat is still comfortable); (4) a glitch IFE system (I would like to think that the situation was not typical)",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300ER,2x4x2
9,bigger and more comfortable,Chris Kuo,Taiwan,8th August 2017,," The cabin and seats were average, mainly because it's a bit old. However, they managed it to be clean enough. Moreover, compared with a previous flight on their B777, the seats on this flight is wider, bigger and thus more comfortable. The seat basket offers sufficient pockets for my phone, book, etc. It was nice. The biggest issue is the in-flight entertainment system, the screen couldn't be used by finger touch, and overall the movies were outdated. The screen was old and thus the pixels were bad.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2

Has storage for phone, power outlet, USB next to TV screen.Price is really reasonable.seta pocket has lots of storage space. Noise canceling headphones offered too. Just fantastic!",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300ER,2x4x2
2,seat recline is limited,P Teck,Singapore,25th May 2017,," The seat is not as clean. There are some spots & stains on the seat. I could not figure out if the seats are not clean or the seats are worn out. Leg room is reasonable for an Asian like me. The seat recline is limited and uncomfortable at an awkward angle. Seat could be wider for what I paid for. Aisle space is alright & average. In flight entertainment is jaded, old & hanged on me.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200 ER,3x3x3
7,box of the entertainment system,D Matryevo,Russian Federation,18th April 2017,," My standard economy class seat was larger than in the same Boeing 777 operated by other airlines. But just under ""H"" aisle seats there was a box of the entertainment system and it took half of under seat space. I was happy with the reclining degree and the distance between seats. But I would recommend ""G"" seat if you like aisle seats. The screen was very small as it was one of the old Singapore Airlines aircrafts.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3
2,seats recline too far,M Millward,United Kingdom,22nd February 2017,,"❎ Unverified |  Awful space compared to Boeing 777. Under the seats in row D is the electrics box meaning less room for your feet or bag. Putting my bag under the seat was a tight squeeze. The seats recline too far back in economy meaning when the person in front reclined fully, I could barely move and I am only 5ft 2! I could not get anything out of my bag under the seat in front when the person in front was fully reclined. When I politely asked the person in front if he could move the seat up a bit, all I got was a mouthful of abuse and had to be moved elsewhere by staff because I complained about him.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A350-900,3x3x3
5,was overall disappointed,John Stokke,Norway,5th February 2017,," Spent the extra money to fly Premium Economy but was overall disappointed. Looked forward to being on the A380 but the Boeing 777 was used instead due to less demand. Boeing 777 is way noisier. Seats are good and more spacious compared to some airlines, but not as good as airlines such as Air New Zealand Premium Economy. Service is good, but we were expecting much more from a 5 star airline. Flight Attendants are friendly but they do not engage in small talk. Could be more personal. Entertainment did not work properly for entire flight. Rebooted several times but it still got jammed. Our luggage never made it to our final destination (last flight domestic). Singapore Airlines blames SAS and SAS blames Singapore Airlines. No compensation for our luggage being delayed 2 days or for overall flight experience. Should have saved my money and flown Economy instead. Would probably fly Economy with Singapore Airlines but found Qantas and Air New Zealand much better overall.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777,2x4x2
9,on par with the Lufthansa seat,A Khalide,United States,8th January 2017,," I was fairly happy with the newish Singapore Airlines A380 premium economy seat. It was a comfortable seat with good recline. And offered a footrest and a a calf support thingy that rises up. Things that other airlines don't necessarily have on all their seats. I did have a few gripes, one was that the state of the seats seemed dated. The holder for the magazines was broken and needed to be handled carefully so that the magazines don't fall out. My footrest was extremely difficult to pull down, although others seemed fine. The inflight entertainment system was the old one and given how long it's been since they introduced the new system I was hoping they'd have it on all their premium economy products. There were no complimentary bottles on the seat before take off, something I noticed on Lufthansa. Overall a very comfortable seat and flight, but on par with the Lufthansa premium economy seat. ",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A380,2x4x2
7,more than enough legspace,Guido Stevens,Netherlands,15th November 2016,,"Amsterdam to Singapore, Seat 52G on an A350. Excellent seat, very comfortable, more than enough legspace. The flight was smooth and the 12 hours went by without problems. Return flight also in Seat 52G. Because we flew an hour longer and had a very bumpy flight for at least 6 or 7 hours (Singapore to Pakistan) because of bad weather and strong headwinds the flight wasn't that comfortable as on the way to Singapore. For the last 3 hours I noticed backpains at the lower back, and because of a not so friendly man behind me I couldn't put my seat further back. The aislespace on the A350 did not seem as wide as on B777.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A350,3x3x3
8,seat is very comfortable,Peter Tsai,Hong Kong,21st August 2016,,"The seat is very comfortable and the cushion is very good. The pillow is good and the blanket is a long one. However, the catering is so so. They are not offering cocktail drinks before the 1st meal as I felt so bad that the singapore sling is the best and signature drink for singapore airline.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x3x3
6,not a lot of personal space,Thomas Evers,New Zealand,10th June 2016,," Frankfurt to Auckland via Singapore all on B777. All sectors window seat. Generally disappointed with Singapore Airlines Premium Economy.  Seats are better than Economy but only just! Legroom okay but recline not great and for me at 6'2"" the legrest added nothing. There was not a lot of personal space or places to put things. Biggest disappointment was food service. Everything served on one tray at same time. Food style, quality and general appearance exactly the same as economy. There was an extra choice of main course. Staff made no extra effort around service. A glass of wine served with meal - then a 20 minute wait for a refill.With Singapore Airlines in Premium Economy you feel slightly better than economy. Premium Economy is a relatively new offering from SQ and I feel they are playing catch up, but do not want to compromise their excellent Business Class, so seem to be keeping PE a step down.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777,2x4x2
9,seats very comfortable,Graeme Bray,Australia,12th May 2016,,"Flew SYD-SIN and SIN-NRT return in 31A and 35A respectively on Singapore Airlines A380 in premium economy. Seats were very comfortable with nice width and support. The screens were very good, clear and large for watching the IFE. The dual pockets in the seat backs are nice and big with one filled with magazines and the other empty for a jacket or laptop, however row 31 only has a basic pocket on the wall. There are numerous other pockets and cubby holes surrounding the seat for any devices or needs. The seat armrests are nice and wide, with a folding table inside, meaning that you are not fighting with your neighbour for it. Leg rests and seat recline made it very comfortable for sleeping. The reading lights over the shoulder seem like a good idea but in reality, they can shine brightly inadvertently at the row in front and they have a narrow beam of light, making reading a large newspaper a chore. Row 35 lacked overhead locker space as the partition wall blocks the door from opening.",Singapore Airlines ,Premium Economy,A380,2x4x2
8,very comfortable seat,Andre Moreitz,Australia,21st April 2016,,"Seat 54H is a very comfortable seat near the wing. Quiet area. Comfortably padded and enough width. I am of average build, 180cms tall. Good legroom. Could easily get out of the seat even when passenger in front reclined theirs. USB charging station and great, easy to use Entertainment system. Headphones are poor though, sound below par. I recommend using subtitles if you really want to hear every word of the movie.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
9,seat was comfortable,Yehezkiel Kertajadi,Indonesia,13th February 2016,,"The old Economy Class seat in Singapore Airlines Boeing 777-300ER is just fine. The seat was comfortable (only for a 1 hour flight). With good entertainment system, KRISWORLD. However, the personal IFE touchscreen is not as good as the new one installed on the newer Boeing 777-300ER. The footrest was a major winner in this leg.  It was a good flight.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x3x3
8,the flight was great,L Curley,Singapore,9th November 2015,,"I was traveling from London LHR to Singapore SIN. It took me 3 minutes to get checked in and boarding took us 10 minutes! The cabin crew were friendly and polite. Although my entertainment screen was damaged and did not work. Fortunately on the the cabin crew members offered to change my seat as the flight was not full.  The food was amazing and juice was great. The turbulence was terrible, it took us 45mins to get out of the storm! In the end the flight was great.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x3x3
4,seats cramped for leg/knee room,S Cooper,Australia,15th September 2015,,"Selected the A380 flight Sydney to Singapore in preference to earlier/later flights serviced by Boeing 777 aircraft to compare the A380. Unfortunately flight booked through co-share partner Virgin Australia and unable to pre-book seats, so confined to lower deck middle aisle at rear. Found seats cramped for leg/knee room, width about average, in flight entertainment a little behind but okay. Overall seat comfort average to a little below. Spoken with friend who have flown SIA on the top deck and had good reports and reviews - unable to confirm this. I think the 777 or 340 are a little better and would not go out of my way to fly A380 again unless on top deck.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380 - lower deck,3x4x3
3,Very little leg room,Christopher Tyas,United Kingdom,26th August 2015,,"Very little leg room for a 13 hour flight. The food was ok, the entertainment machine was very good, the service up and down with a bit of attitude. Overall a poor experience. Business seats were half empty but no offers of upgrade at check-in. We would have been happy to pay more to avoid the awful economy seats.  Awful reclining seats so the person in front stuck the back of their seat in your face. ",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x3
3,Boeing 777-300ER a distinct improvement,Peter McCaskill,New Zealand,19th August 2015,,"Old Boeing 777-200ER on the Christchurch to Singapore leg should be withdrawn from service as they are well past their ""use by"" date. The Boeing 777-300ER on Singapore to Amsterdam/Barcelona were a distinct improvement and would have no hesitation using this airline again if we were not subjected to poor A/C and facilities of the old stock.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3-4-3
4,leg space quite inadequate,Iain Watson,Australia,15th August 2015,,Singapore Airlines seats were very narrow and leg space quite inadequate even for a short person like me.  I found the seats on their older Boeing  777 200 to have more leg room and also wider and a lot more comfortable. Don't know if there has been a downsizing of the seat width and leg room resulting from the new premium economy seats being installed in the aircraft.   Service from cabin staff was excellent. I would travel on selected flights in the future depending on the aircraft type. Would not use Singapore Airlines A380 economy again.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
9,very nice seat,Timotheus Krahl,Malaysia,25th July 2015,,"Very nice seat, you were able to move the cushion back and forth and not only the backrest. Did not see any power outlets other than the USB, but was not in need for it. However the iPod function does not work as I hoped, it picked random songs from the phone, no AirPlay.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
8,cabin was a bit worn out,T Krahl,Malaysia,25th July 2015,,"The cabin was a bit worn out, Singapore Airlines is currently retrofitting all of its 777 and my flight was just the ""wrong"" plane. They will soon introduce Premium Economy on the route to Sydney, so getting a retrofitted plane will be a safe bet on this route starting in middle of August. ",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3
9,service was also excellent,A Butler,United States,15th July 2015,,"Los Angeles to Tokyo. The legroom and footrest were really comfortable. For dinner, I had the pork chop, which was the best airline food I've had. On the tv, they had many selections of music, movies, shows and much more. The service was also excellent. ",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
10,large leg room,Ian Chow,Singapore,13th July 2015,,"Large leg room. On the 2nd deck, there's even a personal side compartment for passengers to store their personal belongings. Comfortable seats with neck support and ample room to move every once in awhile.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
6,sub standard seating and entertainment,C Waugh,Australia,9th July 2015,,"I love Singapore Airlines - however having flown twice out of Melbourne I don't understand why they out such an old aircraft on this route. Sub standard seating and entertainment and the plane looks shabby. Flying out of Singapore is a different story - newer aircraft and a completely different flying experience. Saying that, Singapore Airlines service is fabulous and they do a lot with the Y class product - just wish they flew newer aircraft out of Melbourne! What's with people who recline seats in economy?",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x3x3
10,seats were great,Adam Koh,Singapore,22nd June 2015,,"HKG-SIN flight was great. The amount of legroom was good for me and the IFE was fantastic. The seats were great, comfortable and could recline decently. Service could be better as they looked tired. Overall, it is a great airline to fly with!",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x3x3
9,seat is well-cushioned,William Lay,Indonesia,18th June 2015,,Singapore-Surabaya. The seat is very comfortable and the seat is well-cushioned and enough leg room for tall people. The entertainment is very good with latest movies and good flight map information provided.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330-300,2x4x2
9,good seat pitch,Duncan Kauffman,Australia,17th June 2015,,"Leather headrest wings were very comfortable indeed. Excellent amount of space in the overhead lockers. Good seat pitch. Folding tray table designed cleverly. Only drawback is lack of touchscreen functionality on VOD, which required using the handset whose buttons had begun to lose their responsiveness. Overall a great economy class seat.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
8,not very accessible,Jordan Ng,Singapore,13th June 2015,,Access to aisle was not very accessible. The in-flight entertainment would make up for it.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
2,the least legroom I've experienced,John Nowlan,Canada,28th January 2015,,Seats have the least legroom I've ever experienced. Clearly designed for short people. The in-seat TVs are a good size but controls confusing. They need touch screen.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x3x3
6,seat is very comfortable,K Lo,Hong Kong,19th November 2014,,The seat is very comfortable and the seat is well-cushioned and enough leg room for tall-people. As the flight is from Tokyo to LAX so the temperature is very high for non-Japanese. Wide selection for PTV and catering is very good and they have a good Japanese bento for inflight meal.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
1,smallest economy seats in the sky,P Borschberg,Singapore,19th November 2014,,SIA must have some of the smallest economy seats in the sky! I have had better ones in budget airlines. Very uncomfortable narrow and not enough leg room. The only thing going for it was the size of the monitor.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x3x3
8,quite satisfactory leg room,Harsh Mehta,India,3rd March 2014,,B777-200ER: Economy Class. (BOM-SIN). Comfortable seats with quite satisfactory leg room. Recline angles need improvement as the seats must recline to comfort during long haul flights which seems to be missing.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200ER,3x3x3
1,seats were very uncomfortable,J Barnes,United Kingdom,13th January 2014,,These seats were very uncomfortable. They didn't seem to have any padding and were really hard. I had back trouble for a week after both trips London/Singapore Singapore/London. The head rests were also uncomfortable. I travelled on the A380 in March 2012 and that one was better. A number of passengers were saying the same thing. Apart from that the plane felt very spacious and the service wonderful.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x3x3
2,not at all comfortable,Michael Lovatt,United Kingdom,12th January 2014,,The A380 economy seat even in the $50 surcharged premium seats are fitted with very thin cushions to save weight. They are ok for a short flight of 1-2 hours but not at all comfortable for 13 hours long haul.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
10,seat is quite comfortable,Huy Vu,Vietnam,12th January 2014,,Singapore-Male. The seat is quite comfortable with wide space. The entertainment is excellent with latest movies and music I can keep track where I am by flight information. The food is good not good as Malaysia Airlines but the attitude of the crew when they serve you meals is excellent.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A330-300,2x4x2
5,very clean and tidy inside,R Woodward,Australia,20th April 2013,,First of all if you are planning on flying the A380 with SQ I would suggest you get in early and book an upper deck seat. The cabin is much quieter than the main deck making it easier to sleep etc on long trips. The aircraft appeared to be new and was . As for the seating itself economy class is not as comfortable as I expected with the seats feeling somewhat smaller and more cramped then the cozy older generation seats in the SQ B777-200 that flies from Singapore to Manila. The entertainment system food customer service however were all excellent on all my SQ flights. Being a rather small asian framed person I think it would be quite difficult for a 6ft European to travel long distances in the SQ A380 economy class but I doubt any other carriers would offer anything better without having to pay for business class. In terms of seat width legroom and access these seats felt no better than the Jetstar A330 that also flies Melbourne-Singapore. All in all I would probably take SQ again on my next business trip to Asia given their competitive pricing at the moment (SQ is at least $300 cheaper than Philippine Airlines when travelling between Aus and Phil). Changi airport is always a pleasure to use and as mentioned before the customer service with SQ is very good on and off the aircraft.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2
7,pleasantly surprised at the level of comfort,I Hamilton,Australia,22nd January 2013,,I was pleasantly surprised at the level of comfort of the cattle class seating. I was travelling with my wife and we were fortunate enough to have a row of 3 seats to ourselves on both legs of the flight. While this allowed us a deal more comfort I have not factored this into this review. My score is based on the overall comfort of a single seat. The A380 is a very comfortable and quiet aircraft service of cabin staff was exceptional food was good however the entertainment selection onboard was perhaps not as varied as I had expected.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
3,getting out was a real challenge,A Percy,United Kingdom,18th January 2013,,We were put in the downstairs cabin - real cattle class. When the person in front reclined their seat when I was eating the tray hit my stomach. I am not a big person. Screen was so close to my eyes it gave me a headache after less than an hour. Getting out was a real challenge even though I had an aisle seat. There was no room to stand upright or even close to upright so I was at an angle of 45 deg and had to support my weight on one arm. Very disappointed.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
1,most uncomfortable seats ever,Martin Dufton,Australia,1st January 2013,,I don't get it. The best plane and they come up with the single worst most uncomfortable seats ever. Not sure what they were thinking but next holiday we are going Qatar Airways simply for the comfort factor.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2
1,very uncomfortable impossible to sleep,Jacques Zimmer,France,24th December 2012,,Frankfurt-Singapore return. Very hard seat on upper deck poor recline very uncomfortable impossible to sleep.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
1,split my family up,James Stirling,United Kingdom,22nd October 2011,,Singapore Airlines split my family up despite booking several months in advance for a round trip from Heathrow to Singapore. The plane is quiet and food was quite good too. I thought the seating was poor because it is obviously designed with no thought to Westerners that are tall or full bodied and seat legroom is worse than other airlines. The service from the cabin crew was clinical and without a smile most of the time. In future I will not use Singapore Airlines.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
1,no seat recline at all,Dan Benhamou,Singapore,22nd October 2011,,I got the last seat on the plane furthest back. Avoid this seat at all cost - no seat recline at all! Conclusion unless you are in first or business class go somewhere else and do not pay a premium for a company which in fact does not provide you any extra service / experience.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x3x3
6,less seats and less people,James Lo,Indonesia,22nd October 2011,,Similar to some earlier comments the seats were really hard unlike SQ's 777-300ER that I normally flew. The only advantage of flying this A380 is you notice less noise on the cabin. The mood lighting was not that great because it was set only to red and orange LED all the time. My seat was on the upper deck with less seats and less people. I think it is always better to choose such seats. Being seated at the last two rows nearby the toilet (82E) might not be really pleasant due to the smell.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
2,after 5-6 hours my rear is just numb,U Sugianto,Singapore,5th September 2011,,The new SQ seats are hard. I fly regularly the SIN-Paris leg on Economy and after 5-6 hours my rear is just numb I have to get up to let the blood flow. Not only is the seat hard but the extremely limited incline of the backrest only allows your back to rest in a technically still sitting position. And that is hard for a 12-13 hour journey. I don't understand how SQ could have gotten this part so wrong.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,3x3x3
8,seat was nice and square shaped,Calvin Nagra,New Zealand,28th July 2011,,B777-300ER AKL-SIN and B777-200ER SIN-DEL. The 777-200 Economy Class seat was nice and square shaped meaning that it was not narrow like the new Singapore Airlines Economy Class. And it had more leg room and better lumbar support. I think the older Economy Class is much better than the new one.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200ER,3x3x3
4,fell far short,Sue Howie,South Africa,23rd May 2011,,Fell far short of the standards expected on Singapore Airlines. Two weeks later my knees still ache.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
9,seats are solid yet not uncomfortable,Adam Guerin,United Kingdom,23rd May 2011,,I prebook my seat Row 42 or 43 as I use the toilets frequently due to a medical condition. I always find that the seats are solid yet not uncomfortable. Plenty of luggage storage above the seat and accessibility easy too. Egress from the seat is easy and the service is second to none.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
6,find the width of the seat quite uncomfortable,M Goh,Singapore,6th April 2011,,Being small I find the width of the seat quite uncomfortable. Did not recline my seat because of children seated behind. Once the seat in front is reclined the space is even more restricted and stepping out of your seat proved more challenging. If I can help it will not fly on A330 but unfortunately it's the kind of aircraft that SQ flies for the Taipei route.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
5,find the seats small,Casper Yap,United States,5th April 2011,,The 747 is an old product I find the seats small compared to the newer 777 by SQ. I like the arm rests folds up and I managed to lie flat over 4 seats.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 747-400,3x4x3
5,the padding was thin,J Weiss,Canada,5th April 2011,,The padding was thin and I needed to use the pillow as a lumbar support. The combination slide-forward/recline is a good compromise that limits intruding into someone's space when reclining your seat. I wish they would have stuck with the 34 inch pitch found on their 777-200's. Those extra two inches really do make a difference.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x3x3
3,found it extremely difficult to sleep,Michael Laws,Australia,15th December 2010,,The flight attendants were very kind and the food was good but the seats were like sitting on a rock. It was extremely cramped and I found it extremely difficult to sleep during the flight. I'm of a small stature and even I felt cramped. The in-flight pillows and blanket were scratchy. Their Boeing 777-300ER's are slightly better. If you ever go in economy sit on the in-flight pillows to create blood flow but use your own pillow or a jacket for your head if you are going to try to sleep on the flight.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
2,cramped narrow hard seats,Marshall Davies,Australia,15th December 2010,,Cramped narrow hard seats made even more constricted by having the AVOD remote in the side of the armrest. After 2 hours of our MEL-SIN flight both my wife & I were uncomfortable & I resorted to sitting on my pillow for the remainder of the flight. Awkward to get out of during he flight due to the tight seat pitch.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
2,seats incredibly hard and uncomfortable,Catherine Harkess,Singapore,22nd June 2010,,As a PPS Solitaire member that flies extensively all over the world in all classes I can say that the service has declined within the last 18 years. Find the new A380 economy seats incredibly hard and uncomfortable with poor pitch and lousy legroom for long journeys far prefer the old seats. SQ heats the cabin more than comfortably. Seem to offer the same food for the same route month after month after month. Far too popular so no longer can get choice of seats better value for money out there.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
6,as good as I expected,John Burlin,United Kingdom,6th June 2010,,I am 6'4 which is the only reason I am giving the seat a fair rating. It was at least as good as I expected and if I had not had my kids with me I could have gone for a preferred seat at a very low extra of $50. Be prepared to do lots of sideway sitting and stretching if you are 6' plus. SQ experience more than compensated for any legroom shortage though.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
8,there is limited to no overhead storage,Mark Sarakis,Australia,14th January 2010,,Upper Deck : Paid extra to book 71A & C which have no seats in front of them. While this is good there is limited (a small locker usually filled with blankets or other equipment) to no overhead storage and you either have to place your cabin bags in lockers further back (making them difficult to retrieve inflight and on landing) or hope the crew will place them in the crew cupboard in the bulkhead area (some are happy to and some are not!). There is no window at these seats and also no side storage bins. Most significantly the seats are next to the bulkhead section where the baby bassinets are located (there were one or more screaming babies on each leg!). It may be advisable to go with similar seats further back where you may only have people milling around waiting for the toilets.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
7,you can put the seat back at any time,Mark Sarakis,Australia,14th January 2010,,Had seat 59K (last row window). I found the B777 seats more comfortable (width and padding) than those of the A380. With no seat behind you can put the seat back at any time without worrying about others behind you. The bulkhead section nearby houses a galley (no toilets) and while there is some noise it tends only to be noticeable at meal service times. As the last 2 rows are only 2-abreast there is only one person to get past when getting out of your seat (I tend to prefer a window on longhaul as I have a broad upper body and so always tend to get bumped into by passersby on the aisle).,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,B777-200ER,3x3x3
7,food and service excellent,John Whiting,United Kingdom,11th January 2010,,"A380 LHR SIN and return. Upper Deck Seats 71 A and C. These are ""preferred"" seats and need to be booked in advance on the SIA website for a charge of $50 per sector. Well worth the extra as there is no one in front of you and the emergency exit does not intrude from the side (as it does on a 747). I think these are actually better that the exit seats further back on the upper deck as no one came up and stood in front of us on either flight whereas further back people milled around waiting for the toilet. The toilets next to our seats were for business class and curtained off so no one came to look out of the window from there. Seat was OK on the outward journey but felt quite hard and was somewhat uncomfortable towards the end of the return flight (This was probably because I had already sat on a 777-200ER for 10 hours with very hard seats!). Flight felt quite hot on the way back (although there were several people with blankets and jumpers so it may just have been me. I did discover 2 fresh air vents around the emergency exit door which improved matters considerably so it is worth looking for these. A380 noticably quieter that the 777. Food and service excellent as was the AVOD. I woulld certainly choose this airline/aircraft/seat in the future if at all possible.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
1,seats on the A380 are extremely hard,Lawrence Walsh,Australia,11th January 2010,,The economy class seats on the A380 are extremely hard - almost unbearably so for a long haul flight. Based on the hardness of the seats alone I would not fly on this aircraft again. We paid an extra charge to sit at the front of the upper deck economy cabin - do not waste your money - the aircraft windows are not aligned to these seats there is no side storage bin no above storage making it inconvenient to store items for take off and landing and no footrests. The only advantage is it is easier to get up from your seat. Service was not great for Singapore Airlines - and the hard seat - awful!,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
2,hard to get your legs comfortable,M Muller,Australia,11th January 2010,,"The footrest makes it hard to stretch your feet out underneath the seat in front of you, also there is a bar underneath the seat in front of you making it hard to get your legs comfortable.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,B777-300W,3x3x3
4,problem was the hardness of the seat,John Whiting,United Kingdom,10th January 2010,,SIA 777-200ER SIN-AKL and CHC-SIN (all the SAI 777-200 planes to New Zealand are the ER type). Seat pitch was good. The problem was the hardness of the seat and a ridge running accross it. The padding was very thin at the back and probably old and compressed (I pulled the seat cushion up to have a look) and there is a pneumatic cushion at the front of the seat so that you can change the thigh support (via a small button on the front left of the seat cushion operating a valve. There is also a similar pneumatic lumbar support). The problem was firstly the hardness of the seat and secondly the junction between the foam and this pneumatic cushion which caused a ridge that cut into my upper thighs. The overall result is a very uncomfortable seat. Both flights had the full AVOD system which was nice and service was good (but not as good as on the A380) as was the food. The seat would not put me off flying SIA again as the A380 was good and staying overnight at Changi was excellent (40 minutes from aircraft arriving at the gate to checking in at the airport hotel and fantastic and incredibly cheap food at the food court on B2 level) but in future I'd try to fly on the 777-300ER which I believe has the same seats as the A380.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,B777-200ER,3x3x3
4,seat pitch was impossible,S Borggren,United Kingdom,4th December 2009,,Flight in Y class SIN-PER was a miserable experience for 5 hours on the A330-300. The seat pitch was impossible for a tall person like myself.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330-300,2x4x2
6,service standard very good,Michael O'Grady,Australia,4th December 2009,,MEL-SIN and SIN-MEL A380 service. I found the aircraft cabin to be very clean and spacious and the service standard very good. The first sector was on the main deck seat 48K (window) 3x4x3 and the next seat on the upper deck 74K (window) 2x4x2. The seats were well designed and ergonomic however the seat cushion was extremely hard probably the worst I have experienced on a longhaul flight. After two hours I was in pain and had to stand up. The seats have foot rests but these are almost useless for a tall person and when those in front are fully reclined it it almost impossible to get out without the people beside you getting up. The upper deck seating configuration in economy is generally much more pleasant typical of A330/A340 cabins.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
7,seat-width could be an inch or two bigger,Chris Frauches,United States,4th December 2009,,SIA's economy class seat on their B747-400 looks very elegant-with useful adjustable head- rests. Seat-pitch and reclining is generous for economy. However seat-width could be an inch or two bigger. Also padding at the lower-back definitely lacked. All in all an acceptable seat.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,B747-400,3x4x3
5,trapped in the window seat,E Irick,Germany,10th November 2009,,"SIN-MEL didnt realise the configuration of the aircraft was 3x4x3, I would not choose a window seat again as getting up to walk/use restrooms was very difficult and at times impossible. Really liked the footrest and the seat when reclined slid forward slightly. But being trapped in the window seat with person in front fully reclined was a truly horrible experience.",Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
5,very little leg room,Peter Schoenholzer,Australia,10th November 2009,,In the back section of the aircraft where the space gets smaller (2x3x2 seating) aisle seats on 2 section very little leg room. I would recommend this seats to people small in stature. The new seats are not as comfortable as the old ones.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A330-300,2x4x2
5,found seat to be uncomfortable,Martin Jones,Australia,12th October 2009,,Upper deck economy seating is good as only 2 seats next to window with generous storage area next to window seat. Found seat to be uncomfortable after a few hours due to little lumbar support ended up with sore back. seat backs felt hard and recline was not as good as other economy seats.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
3,one of the most uncomfortable seats,Michael Schade,Singapore,6th October 2009,,Economy class 11hrs from Singapore to Johannesburg. One of the most uncomfortable seats I've experienced in 30 years of flying long haul. This seat is a nightmare for any flight beyond 3 hours.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200ER,3x3x3
10,seat pitch and width are very satisfactory,J Wong,Hong Kong,20th September 2009,,The seat pitch and width are very satisfactory. The seat reclines slightly to the back and the seat cushion moves forward when it is fully reclined - excellent. The angle of the movable AVOD screen is large enough for me to see it clearly. The aircraft has installed footrest to each seat but I didn't use it because I am not tall. AVOD system was marvellous as there are many selections of programmes and applications and screen resolution is high.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
7,ended up with very sore shins,J Massey-Green,New Zealand,3rd March 2009,,Sat in 79A. Positives - Window seat has a large locker between the window and the seat meaning that I did not have to get up at all through the flight for laptop/book/iPod/etc. Seats A and C share a 110/240 volt power socket meaning I could watch video on my laptop the whole trip and resting the laptop on the lid of locker meant the laptop could still be open while I ate the meal. Negative - I ended up with very sore shins as when I slept I slid forward and my shins were resting up against the 'footrest'. I tried using the footrest but found it too high to be comfortable - probably a little better for those under 6 foot.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Airbus A380,2x4x2
9,Seats 58A 58K 59A 59K have extra room,Shirley Shih,New Zealand,19th January 2009,,Seats 58A 58K 59A 59K have extra room between the seat and the wall of the airplane - seat layout in the last two rows is 2x3x2.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Airbus Boeing 777-200ER,3x3x3
10,lots of legroom beside the emergency exit,Christian Sagmeister,Austria,13th January 2009,,I´ve had seat 54H on Flight SIN-LHR. There is lots of legroom beside the emergency exit but no footrest. Personal TV is stowed inside the seat.,Singapore Airlines ,Economy Class,Airbus A380,3x4x3
7,Not a bad flight,Alex Hudson,Canada,31st January 2019,0," Not a bad flight, food was pretty good and the attendants were very nice, but as I was trying to sleep it was not very comfortable - would have been ok for a short flight but not great when you are talking 12 hours. Economy would be a whole lot better if the pillows you got were not 4 cm thick and you could block out some of the noise",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
6,width and legroom were quite good,Marcus Wong,Malaysia,15th February 2017,," Flew ANA's Boeing 787. Seat width and legroom were quite good. Felt that it was very spacious. The distance of the IFE system to my face was good. Didn't feel cramped. However, the seat recline was bad. It couldn't seem to recline.  What worse is that it's a red-eye flight back to Kuala Lumpur. By the way, was surprised to see a USB port below my screen because I thought there wouldn't be a USB port there! Seat storage was quite limited. Access to my seat by the window was normal.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
9,34 inch pitch is brilliant,S Bream,Australia,18th December 2016,," Having now done 4 flights with ANA from Sydney to Europe,  the economy seat configuration basically seems to be 34” if you’re on a Boeing 787-9 and 31” on a Boeing 787-8. The 787-9 is missing a window around row 33/34 (or seat 38 in the 40-row version), but actually, when both seats are reclined, everybody gets a bit of window. I travelled in the exit row window, 28A, and the same applies — you see a little when reclined. The escape chute was not too “bothersome” however the general wall curvature around that area makes the A/B seats even squashier than usual laterally and I wouldn’t choose it again. That’s the real pity about these planes: instead of 8 across, most airlines have crammed 9, making the 787 synonymous with extremely narrow seats. The 34 inch pitch is brilliant though (hence my rating) — if you can be certain you’ll be flying in a 787-9; my leg HND—CDG which was scheduled as a Boeing 787-9 when I bought it suddenly got a Boeing 787-8 substituted and legroom was unbearable as soon as you reclined your seat. If I was reviewing that flight it'd be 5/10.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-9,3x3x3
7,service is outstanding,Mayer Sng,Singapore,24th September 2016,," Travelled from Sapporo to Tokyo (Narita). Was a really short flight, but service is outstanding! Cabin crew walked around to hand out blankets and sweets before take off. No meal service though. But drinks and soup were available! Even in a short flight, headsets were still given for us to watch the overhead flight entertainment system. Seat were comfy enough for the whole ride and had a really pleasant flight though communication with the cabin crew was a little hard.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
9,seat itself is quite roomy,N Shane,Canada,25th May 2016,,"I am not a tall person (5'6) so legroom was never a problem for me. However, I was seated with a guy who is probably about 6'1 and his knees were still not touching the back seat in front of him. The seat itself is quite roomy, clean and comfortable. The headrest and footrest are a bonus feature that makes it your flight bearable. In-seat power (USB and actual power outlet) are available.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8/9,3-3-3
6,struggled with the legroom,Vyshak Vitobha,India,19th April 2016,,"Flew ANA from Delhi to Tokto Narita on a Boeing 767 aircraft. The flight was an overnight 8 hour flight and I was concerned about my night's sleep, which is essential to me. While I tried my best to grab an emergency exit seat, but they were all taken and ended up with an aisle seat. I an 6ft tall and I was seated with a equally tall gentleman and we both struggled with the legroom. I was lucky as I had an aisle seat and could pop my leg out on the aisle every now on them. The service on ANA was excellent. Cabin crew were very helpful and the food was delicious, but the legroom is still an issue.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 767,2x3x2
8,more legroom than B767,Vyshak Vitobha,India,19th April 2016,,"ANA only recently started the Boeing 787 service from Tokyo to Mumbai and I got a chance to fly this route in April 2016. The equipment used on the route is Boeing 787-8, one of the earlier delivered to ANA, probably 2011. While I was lucky to get the emergency exit seat 20K, I managed to try the other seats for legroom. The seats in the Boeing 787 have definitely more legroom than the B767, which I flew to reach Tokyo. However, the seats still did not recline much. I did not bother much as it was day flight. In flight entertainment was very good with latest movies and meals have always been excellent in ANA.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
8,Recommend these seats,Sandy Layadi,Indonesia,29th February 2016,,Tokyo Haneda to Osaka Itami on a Boeing 767-300. Seats was 2x3x2 and it was much more comfortable compared to the Hong Kong to Tokyo Narita. It's now easy to recline than the previous international flight. Legroom was much specious than other aircraft. But no TV screen on the flight. Width was small. Storage was huge and no power supply. Recommend these seats.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 767-300,2x3x2
1,seats not that comfortable,Sandy Layadi,Indonesia,28th February 2016,,"Hong Kong to Tokyo Narita. The 787-8 was not new since it was made in 2011. The seats were not that comfortable, legroom was quite small and recline was so hard, because people behind me told me not to do that. TV screen was near my seat. The storage was small and my power supply didn't work. I will avoid this aircraft in the future. But other ANA service was even better. ",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
2,your neck will be bent,Marcus Fischer,Germany,26th February 2016,,"Had a pretty bad experience with ANA Economy Seats on a recent Boeing 777-300ER flight from Tokyo to Frankfurt. Unlike other economy seats I've experienced, the back of the seat is fixed in a way that the person behind you is not bothered by your reclined seat. When you press your recline button your cushion will move forward (slightly reducing your legroom). As a result the backrest will incline however the headrest will remain fixed and vertical, which means your neck will be bent quite uncomfortably. Not only is it hard to sleep in this position but after a 12 hrs flight you'll also have the stiffest neck you've had for along time.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
4,new arrangement (3x3x3) is poor,Mark Gleeson,Japan,23rd November 2015,,I flew on a ANA Boeing 787 flight from Seattle to Tokyo Narita with my wife and baby daughter. The flight was 10 hours long and we had the bassinet seat at the bulkhead in the rear cabin. I had previously been on the same aircraft type on ANA in the 2x4x2 economy arrangement which was really nice. This new arrangement (3x3x3) is poor. There was much less space and the bassinet / wall design was sculpted making it awkward with reduced space since the cot is mounted low. It has much less space in comparison to their 777 cabin design in a similar seat; or A330/A340 cabin design on another airline. I don't think this narrower width of seat is suitable for long haul travel. I strongly recommend avoiding this plane for those travelling with a baby. ANA flight attendants are wonderful but unfortunately it doesn't make up for poor cabin design sometimes.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
9,seat was nice and comfortable,Mikael Uthaug,Norway,14th September 2015,,ANA All Nippon Airways premium economy class seat was nice and comfortable on this flight with their Boeing 777-300ER.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300ER,2x4x2
10,better than I expected it to be,Jordan Erdmann,United States,28th July 2015,,"ANA's 3x4x3 layout is better than I expected it to be. The seats are comfortable and leave plenty of room for larger westerners to stretch. The aisles are narrower, but no different than domestic airlines in the states. PTV had a great selection of movies and music; my only complaint would be the TV show programming. They feature a lot of popular drama shows from the USA, but no comedies.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
6,lack of space on the aircraft,Howard Cheng,New Zealand,16th July 2015,,"I was really looking forward to a nice flight with ANA on Economy from Tokyo HND to Vancouver YVR, but there is a lack of space on the aircraft, especially for a gruelling 8.5 hours. Seats were thin and as hard, legroom was tight but the worst part was that when you reclined, the seat base slid forward, causing less legroom. The plane was amazing, though, and it was quite an experience to try out the new Dreamliner. The windows dimmed by pressing a button, cabin pressure and humidity was higher and you could feel the difference after a long flight. Cabin crew service was great and the food was, as usual, really tasty and of high standard. I will fly ANA again.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-800,3x3x3
8,seat width was a bit too tight,Chi-Yu Chen,Taiwan,28th January 2015,,I flew SEA-NRT via 787-8 and was a nice ride. I am Asian male but the seat width was a bit too tight. Seat pitch and recline was more than enough. PTV is very accurate and responsive with the USB and audio Jack. I would fly ANA again much better than United.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
2,planes were so hot and stuffy,D Seid,United States,28th January 2015,,I flew ANA roundtrip Honolulu to Haneda Tokyo. The planes were so hot and stuffy that it was terribly uncomfortable. There were blankets on every seat but no one used them in the entire plane. I am not unusually tall. I am Asian but my knees could touch the seat in front of me as the rows were close together. The head rest with flaps did not go up or down to adjust to different heights of people. PTV screens were small. The cabin attendants were smiling and graciously took care of passengers efficiently and the meals were good.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200ER/767-300ER,3x3x3
1,tightest seating configuration,E Meyer,Switzerland,28th January 2015,,MUC-HND on B787. The tightest seating configuration I have experienced on a long haul flight. 16.5 inch wide seat and 31' pitch - this has to be the worst. The in-seat screen from the seat in front of me was so close that it was hard to focus. ANA has gone from having one of the most comfortable economy classes to the very worst.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
8,lots of legroom,R Mahida,United States,25th July 2014,,Bulkhead seat provided lots of legroom to fully stretch out legs plus easy access to aisles even from middle seats. The entertainment system is a pull out style on bulkhead seats.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
1,smallest long-haul seat,E Ruthruff,United States,25th July 2014,,This is the smallest long-haul seat I've ever seen (and I fly a lot). It was 10 hours of discomfort (SEA to NRT) and I was in an aisle seat. The seat pitch is the same as or smaller than low-cost- carriers flying short-haul and the seat width is bad too. The plane was new the video selection was good and the flight attendant's were great but if the seat is tiny you will still be miserable. The plane was hot too which added to the discomfort.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787-8,3x3x3
4,sheer torture with good leg space,D Bhatia,United States,25th July 2014,,SFO to Narita 12 hrs had the exit row seat. Stunned to see how narrow the seat was. I am thin and could just barely fit into the seat. Space is eaten up by the front tray and the tv stowing into the arm rest. But the genius who configured these seats should have thought about the passenger comfort on a long flight. Sheer torture with good leg space.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
3,uncomfortable slouching position,A Megha,United States,3rd March 2014,,"The bottom portion of the seat slides forward in the reclining mode (instead of reclining back) resulting in an uncomfortable slouching position. My feet/legs fell asleep multiple times and I could not find a comfortable position to sleep because there was so little room available. Bear in mind I'm 5'2"" so I can't imagine how this would work for someone taller.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 767-300,2x3x2
3,seat bottom would move forward,N Stash,Singapore,13th January 2014,,Instead of reclining the seat bottom would move forward and it didn't give the same impact (at least to me) as reclining - not comfortable on a long flight.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,2x4x2
3,seat base slides outwards,J Osada,Singapore,13th January 2014,,"The seats on ANA 787 Dreamliner do not recline- the seat base slides outwards towards the seat in front of you. Needless to say this makes a mockery of the ""more legroom"" selling point because now passengers have even less legroom when they ""recline"" their seats. And sliding the seat out from under the chair does not make for a more comfortable seating position since you slouch in the chair and be just as uncomfortable.",ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,2x4x2
9,generous amount of room,R Ryan,United States,10th January 2014,,NRT-PEK on the new 787-8. I was stunned how impressive the economy service is. The seats are in a 3x3x3 arrangement and I had a generous amount of room between me and the person next to me. I was very impressed though that on this 3 hour flight they serve a full meal service in economy. The portions are larger then on my flight from SFO-NRT (12 hour flight) on United. The plane did have western movies in English but very limited choices. Staff were over the top friendly.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
3,very uncomfortable seat pitch,L Andres,United States,15th February 2013,,ANA's B777 from NRT-SEA was awful. Small leg room and very uncomfortable seat pitch.,ANA All Nippon Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x3x3
4,Business class seat was uncomfortable,A Shabeela,Oman,31st August 2021,1," My initial booking was on Economy class and then I upgraded to business class after paying fare difference. Business class seat was uncomfortable. If you're seating on window seat and wanted to move from your seat you will not be able to leave your seat unless you disturb passenger that sitting next to your seat. And if passenger next to you is laying down and sleeping then you need to jump to pass or you must wake up him/she to move seat to seating position. Furthermore, service on board was not to level to business class as I was expecting. In addition, was surprised upgraded ticket was not included using airline lounge in Dubai Airport. Finally it is not worth paying so much money for upgrade to Business class on B787 300 aircraft.",Emirates ,Business Class,Boeing 777-300er,2x3x2
6,drawback was the 2x3x2 configuration,Manan Agarwal,India,14th August 2021,1, This was a Boeing 777-300ER on one of Emirates' older aircraft that did not have  lie-flat seats.  The drawback I would find on this flight was the 2x3x2 configuration (no direct aisle access for window seats and the one middle seat) and how uncomfortable the seat is especially while sleeping. ,Emirates ,Business Class,Boeing 777-300 ER,2x3x2
10,how hard it is to get onto the aisle,Manan Agarwal,India,14th August 2021,1," This was one of Emirates newer business class seats which go lie flat making it comfortable to sleep in.  The seat was wide enough to sit comfortably and was long enough for me to sleep in (I'm 6'2""). Complimentary wifi for skywards members in business worked well and was enough to text. IFE screen was clear and the amenity kit was well stocked. The only drawback I can find with this seat is the lack of privacy on the aisle seats and how hard it is to get onto the aisle when on a window or middle seat.",Emirates ,Business Class,Boeing 777-300 ER,2x3x2
9,Legroom is sufficient,R Shehab,United Kingdom,11th August 2021,1," We were a family of five, and our seats were one middle row plus one seat on the middle-left aisle in front of the middle row we occupied. Seat was comfortable and came with blanket, pillow and pair of headphones and toys for children. The IFE system is the best of airlines we’ve travelled. Most of the content on the system is in English, but there are options in other languages. TV is large. Selection of entertainment for kids was excellent. All seats with a USB port and most seats also with a three-prong electrical socket. Storage space for baggage is ample. Legroom is sufficient for tall passengers. ",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
1,business class is sub standard,L Palvero,United Arab Emirates,7th February 2020,1," Emirates Boeing 777 is a sub standard plane nowadays. Business class layout 2x3x2 is obsolete and very uncomfortable. This is the only business class on long haul that you almost don’t have space for your shoulder and I am pretty small. If you are tall forget to seat here comfortable . It’s unbelievable how poor is the design of this aircraft. Never pay for business class on 777, never ever is an uncomfortable premium economy. I am a frequent flyer with Emirates but the business class in Emirates is sub standard, big gap with any premium airline . Terrible that Emirates such old plane and seat.",Emirates ,Business Class,Boeing 777,2x3x2
1,seats were extremely uncomfortable,Andrew Nguang,Malaysia,12th November 2019,1," Emirates Boeing 777 aircraft from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur an overnight flight and found the experience extremely disappointing. The business class seats were extremely uncomfortable and we found the seat had limited reclining pitch. On the lay flat position, we found ourselves constantly sliding downwards because the seat had a sloping angle. Throughout the flight, we have to constantly force ourselves upwards using our feet because whenever we dosed off the top half of our body forced onto the lower half resulted in a position like to a squat (bend knees & increasing pressure on toes & feet). The resultant effect is complete sleepless, restless & discomfort night, and we were exhausted on our arrival. To make the matter worst, I had my arms and body wedged in the seat (meaning that the seat canopy was not wide enough to fit my body size). And I consider myself as medium built of 175cm @ 85kg. The wedge had caused muscle cramp on my upper body. The decision to book with Emirates business class was to achieve a good sleep in the first place. Of the 7 hours flight, I stayed in laying down position for 6 hours where sleep achieve was less than 10mins. Attempts to resolve the discomfort with flight attendant not long after airborne, and we were told that seat has reached maximum recline position. We would give you 1 star. ",Emirates ,Business Class,Boeing 777,2x3x2
3,seats are okay,S Tumar,United Arab Emirates,6th June 2019,1," The airline has huge drop in quality from last 2-3 years. This flight is good if you travel in business class or else the experience is terrible. Online check in is possible but there is no use, during the check in time we choose a seat and boarding pass also issued as per. Booked around the front part and we received boarding pass at airport with tail seat. Counter staff said its due to the air craft change. But there is no change in the aircraft, seats are okay but service is terrible. Better avoid emirates economy",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380-800,3x4x3
6,you cannot rest properly,Alain Kupferman,Thailand,6th May 2019,1," Business Class seats in the Boeing 777 are not comfortable and you cannot rest properly, as there are many angles, which are disturbing if your are tall; the length of the safety belts is a problem if you are even slightly overweight",Emirates ,Business Class,Boeing 777,2x3x2
1,I can’t recline or sleep,Zahid Jamil,United Kingdom,1st April 2019,1," On the Boeing 777-300 new business class seats when I recline I can only stretch one leg, which means I can’t recline or sleep. Only the front row seats allow full recline with both legs stretched. For goodness sake please stop these ridiculous business class seats. I can’t believe that Emirates didn’t realize this itself. Also the width of the seat is much less than before. Was very dissatisfying.",Emirates ,Business Class,Boeing 777-300,2x3x2
6,Legroom was average,F Mahban,Germany,28th September 2018,1," The legroom of the A380 is okay. The seats are not too tight, as the A380 is quite a wide plane. Recline was broken on my seat, but what I saw was average. Legroom was also average. All in all, in my opinion, it is not worth paying the extra money compared to the competition.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
6,charging to book seats,G Weare,United Kingdom,31st May 2018,1," Emirates have joined the race to the bottom and started charging to book seats like other airlines? Fine, do this for extra legroom/bassinet seats and maybe the upper deck economy seats on your two-class A380s but not for every seat on the plane. I paid for a window seat on both legs (JNB-DXB-MAN) as I didn't want to run the risk of being placed in the middle of a 3 and luckily ended up with 3 seats to myself as on the first flight the passenger on the aisle upgraded to business class, and on the second they moved elsewhere. Overall still a great airline and economy class better than most (especially on the A380) but re-think the seat charging policy, which adds a significant cost to the ticket especially for an average family of 4.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
4,seats need to be redesigned,K Mackie,Australia,17th November 2017,, The seats need to be redesigned to create a feel of more room and comfort. Very cramped compared to A380 could take a look at some other airlines seating on similar planes. I know that airlines try to save money but they don't need to reduce passenger comfort in doing so.,Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
6,horribly dated IFE system,Nawaaf Koodaruth,United Kingdom,1st November 2017,," The seat was alright, however, it had a horribly dated IFE system and the seat just wasn't as comfortable as Emirates latest product. Food was alright, but isn't going to win many awards. Overall, the cabins on this Boeing 777-300ER aircraft are in bad need of upgrading, because their A380s are a lot better at the moment. My advice: avoid their 777s unless it is essential. Top marks for the content on their IFE and the charging ports, though. Their WiFi was slow, but was good enough to catch the Carabao cup draw!

3,disappointingly cramped conditions,M Kendrick,United Kingdom,28th September 2017,,"❎ Unverified |  Huge aircraft but disappointingly cramped conditions for long haul. My flight was cancelled moments before the gate was due to open. The flight was rescheduled for next day but crew claimed I was too ill to fly. I was offloaded despite my telling them I was not ill I just needed my medication. They then went through a show of calling a doctor in the US but by this time our bags had been taken off, so it had already been decided to offload us. The purser advised a doctor was waiting to see me and if he declared me fit to fly I could be on the next flight. All lies to get me off the plane, as there was no doctor and we were told to go home and see our own doctor and obtain a fit to fly letter. The airline then rebooked us onto a flight the next day but failed to tell us about it. So, four days after an attempt to fly with Emirates to Shanghai via Dubai, I am still in the UK with no ticket and no travel plans. Travel Emirates? Never again. There are much better airlines out there.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
5,Very narrow seats,Mark Ellwood,United Kingdom,25th September 2017,," Lucky to have an Extra Legroom seat which I paid for. 24A Window seat has no window but extra legroom. Bussed to remote stand to board aircraft from rear. Not a full flight so able to move about and have 2 seats. Food okay, nothing special and staff just doing what they had to. Very narrow seats, good inflight entertainment.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
10,my favorite economy class seat,Thomas Maresh,United States,15th August 2017,," I flew Colombo to Dubai and Emirates has my favorite economy class seats and is one of the few economy seats that are comfortable for me. When I look at buying economy tickets on my budget, I have to look at the seat size. It is worth it to me to get an economy seat with Emirates.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
2,configuration in 380 is the worst ever,M Fisher,United Kingdom,2nd August 2017,,"❎ Unverified |  Very disappointed. Seats were packed in tightly, no legroom and the passenger in front reclined her seat throughout the journey making it extremely impossible for me to eat comfortably or sit in a comfortable position for an overnight flight from Dubai to Bangkok. I was looking forward to experiencing the A380. However, Emirates have configured the economy class seating to suit their profit rather than customer comfort. Of all of the airlines I have flown with, the economy configuration in the Emirates 380 is the worst ever.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
6,seats are quite uncomfortable,E Damitri,Italy,3rd June 2017,," The seats are quite uncomfortable for people higher than 1,80 and in particular if in economy class, three people higher over 1,80 with normal shoulders are seated in the same row this can cause several problem to all three. The seat-back are too narrow in all the Boeing 777 categories and a flight of 4.5 hours can be acceptable but a flight with the same plane (Boeing 777-200 LR) a flight of 14/16 hours could be not comfortable for an higher person.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200 LR,3x4x3
8,pleasant seating experience,Bhavin Ajay Dholakia,United States,26th May 2017,," The Boeing 777-300 ER seat was comfortable with sufficient recline, back support & lumbar support. Legroom was as expected & made matters worse due to the long travel time of 12.5 hours. The food tray table was a little too intruding & made matters worse but might vary as per an individual's build. The ICE in flight entertainment was top notch except for the sluggish touchscreen. There was 1 universal power supply outlet provided next to the TV screen. Overall a pleasant seating experience.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300 ER,3x4x3
8,Legroom is just about ok,Imtiaz Quwailid,United Kingdom,30th December 2016,," Seats were chosen when I booked online 7 months prior. Requested Row 42J/K on the A380 and 46J/K on the Boeing 777. On the A380, Row 42 is the second row from the front on the lower deck, meaning there is no middle set of seats, just the forward stairs going to the upper deck (business and first class seats). Also, being forward of the wing and engines mean it's a quieter part of the cabin. The seat width is sufficient for the 7 hour journey between London and Dubai. Legroom is just about ok, but when the seat in front is reclined, you do have to make an adjustment if you are watching the tv screen. Screen is a good size, and the ICE entertainment system offers a vast selection of movies and box sets to keep you occupied. A good plus is that these films can be started immediately, so you can start your entertainment while the aircraft is still preparing for departure. However, we were surprised that the cabin crew come round to collect the headsets prior to landing. My advice is always travel with your own headsets (and adaptors). There are charging ports available so if you are using your own equipment, you won't run out of juice. Food and drink is complimentary (as is expected from an airline of this standard). However, the meal choice was the same as offered on the same route in 2013. Would have thought the menu could have been changed in three years. On the Boeing 777, Row 46 is five rows from the rear of the aircraft and as such, is the first Row where the layout reduces from 3-4-3 to 2-4-2. If you are travelling as a couple, the side seats on Rows 46 to 49 are the ones to aim for (Row 50 suffers from being too close to the galley and toilets). Seats are fine in width, but as they have three seats in front, you can angle your legs across to get more legroom. So a definite plus there. We had booked the same rows for our return flights. Would definitely recommend if you're travelling on these aircraft.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380-800 / Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
6,how uncomfortable it would be,Raju Lalwani,United States,21st December 2016,," Flew from Chicago to Dubai on Emirates Boeing 777. I heard that they have a 3x4x3 configuration but didn't realize how uncomfortable it would be. My wife and myself got one of the 2 seaters way in the back. I could easily get my butt into the seat but for the first time realized that along with the seat width, you need to consider the breadth of a person. Your overarm is always larger than your hips and hence, my wife and myself were literally getting into each other's space. For the seats, I have to sadly give Emirates a 1 star. Service on this sector was magnificent. The flight attendant that was taking care of us truly had a very proactive mind set and was taking care of all the passengers very very well. Food was very good for a coach class. Movie selection was terrific. Wouldn't get bored at all.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
8,was perfect for me,D Norlan,Qatar,20th November 2016,, This was an aisle economy seat right up front at 18C on an Emirates Boeing 777 200. I'm a fat guy so the seat is important for me. The seat belt was plenty long enough and the isle front row gave me lots of leg room. The seat included a fold out screen and was not too confining for me even though it was bulk head economy. This was perfect for me.  This flight was cheaper and better. I've very happy.,Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777 200,3x4x3
1,seats very narrow and squashed,Alistair Christison,South Africa,6th November 2016,," The seats on this Emirates Boeing 777-300ER aircraft are very narrow and squashed. They are not suited to long haul flights at all. The average sized man will spend the whole flight overlapping into the next seat and competing with his next door seat occupant for shoulder and elbow room. The choice of an aisle seat means you will continually be bumped by passing staff and trolleys. I have no idea what entered Emirates mind when they introduced this tiny seat, but I handed back my Frequent flyer card on the last flight of a set of 4 since I will have no further use for it on aircraft of this type.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
9,A380 seat was large,Taufiq Suryana,Indonesia,30th October 2016,," The A380 seat was large and the legroom is comfy as I am 180 cm. But when your seat near the window it's difficult to go if you want go to toilet. Because the headset plug in to LCD not your seat, you must ask people who seat near you to stand up and unplug their headset. The LCD is usual some difficult to operate because the touch screen not really sensitive. And some are good. But anyway you can use your remote to operate it.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
5,small and cramped seats,K Rutter,Australia,6th October 2016,, I have had to fly from Adelaide to Frankfurt four times within 12 months. One trip was ex Perth via the Airbus 380 which was just passable and the rest via Boeing 777. It seems that the people that design airplane seats never travel in economy class for more than a couple of hours. I am totally amazed that the airlines are getting away with these small and cramped seats for long haul flights. Fortunately I am not the tallest person and I feel sorry for someone that is a bit taller than I am because I feel very uncomfortable after about 3 hours. There are no foot rests available. Unfortunately I can’t afford to fly Business class but if the airlines priced this more realistically more people would avail themselves of this.,Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
2,seats narrow and uncomfortable,Barry Anderson,United States,5th September 2016,,"The seats in Economy Class on the Emirates Boeing 777s I flew were too narrow and uncomfortable. Emirates and other airlines who use 3x4x3 seating in a B777 should re-think this. The 777 is very comfortable when it has 3x3x3 seating, but squeezing an extra seat in makes the experience very unpleasant - awkward both physically and culturally. Also, though Emirates is rightly proud of its extensive IFE selection, the touch screen was very awkward to use, the the headphones delivered very poor sound quality.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
9,always choose an aisle seat,Iain Webster,United Kingdom,30th August 2016,,"I fly frequently on Emirates usually between London and Asia. Personally I would rather fly via DXB with a short leg stretch and break the journey into two chunks. Otherwise 14 or 15 hours in economy just gets boring. When you consider seat comfort, inflight entertainment, seat power and Wifi the Emirates back cabin is superior to premium economy on many others. I always choose an aisle seat, centre and on the odd occasion when flights are not completely full it is pretty much guaranteed to get an empty adjacent seat.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
4,Seats narrow with little leg room,Sandra Jupe,Australia,28th August 2016,,"We fly back from Madrid to Adelaide in 2 days time after being away for just over 5 weeks commencing our holiday in Prague. It has taken me 5 weeks for my ankles to stop swelling. I am 5'8"" / 173cm tall and average build. Seats on both flights were narrow with little leg room. It has been over 3 years since we last flew. I always regarded Emirates as one of the top airlines with comfortable seats, good leg room and elbow space and excellent service. I now take this back. The service was no where near their high standard. Each time I've flown previously, the flight attendants have been friendly, helpful with all passengers and walked through the cabin offering water. This is the first time I've flown getting off both flights very dehydrated and with swollen ankles. Wake up Emirates. Qatar Airways fly into Adelaide now and their economy seats are larger. Seats 18D and 46D.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER / A380-800,3x4x3
9,good seat with good service,Clement Tong,Hong Kong,11th July 2016,,Good seat with good service. The seat itself is comfortable comparing for other airlines but not a really special point for choosing this airline. ,Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
6,seats are too small and rigid,Sufyan Mohammed,Saudi Arabia,27th March 2016,,"It was a good experience, but I had disappointment in some area for example, foods, it was so cold and it consists of 2 mini sandwiches, nuts, small piece of Konafa and water. Also, the seats are too small and rigid. The trip was too short (approximately 1hr) but I had some of back pain! I don’t know how the people travel 15 hour flight with those seats! The seat screen was big and the contents were good and a lot of choices, but the Arabic songs were not too much. I you want to sleep and you do not want anyone wake you up even when the food came, you have only put a sticker in top of your seat and no one will wake you up. Generally, my experience was good but I will make a lot of thinking when I may choose this airline in the future.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
4,seats very close together,Louis Marr,Australia,22nd February 2016,,"

Flying from Adelaide to Dubai on an Emirates Boeing 777-300 was very average, the seats were very close together and the only storage space was in the tiny seat back pocket or under the seat but half was cut off by the IFE box. The seat back power supply was really annoying as it worked if I put pressure on the plug. Seat recline was average and seat width was a bit narrow. The IFE screen was fine though and worked without issues.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
5,most uncomfortable flight,Niranjan Patel,United Kingdom,20th January 2016,,"Travelled in Economy Class from Dubai to London. We were a group of 4 seated in Zone D seat 32. During the whole flight there was a very cold breeze above our heads, in spite of all air vents closed. Cabin crew were made aware of this and we were told that the temperature could be adjusted by them. If they did anything, it did not make any difference. It was one of the most uncomfortable flight we have flown.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
2,not for long haul flights,Anne Newman,United Kingdom,6th January 2016,,"Seats very narrow and uncomfortable, the A380 may be the largest airliner for carrying passengers but they have cut down on the sizes of the seats. Hardly any padding on the seats, very basic and certainly not for long haul flights.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
5,not up to date plane,Floris den Hartog,Netherlands,22nd December 2015,,"Love flying with Emirates A380. Excellent, even in economy class. However the Boeing 777-300 from Dubai to Chennai on the 21th of dec was an old, not up to date plane. Emirates unworthy. The economy seats are old, not wide enough. Not up to current standards. That 1 inch extra does miracles. The IFE was also outdated. Happy the service is not outdated, but very good staff. Not looking forward to the return flight as both legs are on a Boeing 777-300.

9,Extremely comfy seat,David Brown,United Arab Emirates,7th December 2015,,"Seat 24A in front row of upper deck Economy section of Emirates brand new 2 class A380, used on Bangkok Dubai sector. Bulk head seat but generous leg room and good seat width. Extremely comfy seat. Window seat but no window, but compensated by shelf and side storage compartment. The upper deck economy section is much smaller than the main deck and service is fast and attentive.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380 2 class,2x4x2
8,good for economy,Hasan Sarwar,United States,30th November 2015,,New York to Dubai return. Outbound Middle aisle seat and return a window seat. Must say they were both good for economy. I was able to catch some sleep. Food and drink plentiful. Had 3 choices of entrees. I like A380 over Boeing 777s. I think it's much smoother.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
5,Seat was pretty good,Paul Bertram,United Kingdom,21st November 2015,,"Not impressed with the service onboard or the food! Flew London to Hong Kong via Dubai and return. Seat itself was pretty good along with the entertainment system but we felt that the crew were uninterested in the passengers and saw them as a inconvenience, the meals were below average bar the final one. Not really feeling the Emirates experience I'm afraid.",Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
5,seating uncomfortable,Laila Al Tamimi,Australia,30th October 2015,,"Emirates seems like two different airlines. Their A380 provide economy passengers with good legroom, wide and comfortable seats. Everything modern and hi-tech. Step aboard their 777s and it is a shock for the unwary. Just because it is possible to squeeze 10 seats across on the 777, does not mean it is a sensible thing to do. Many other airlines still have 3-3-3 seating on their 777s. Emirates has 3-4-3.  I found the seating uncomfortable. If the person seated next to you isn't a close friend or relative, it is going to be uncomfortably intimate.  For a short flight, the 777 is adequate. On long-haul routes, it is a poor choice. Emirates service is almost always efficient, and the inflight entertainment is excellent. The downfall is the seating on the 777s.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
5,never fly with Emirates again,Carol Browning,Australia,10th October 2015,,I will never fly with Emirates again. The aisle was very narrow as were the seats on this Boeing 777 with 3x4x3 layout. I had to tuck my elbows tightly into my sides to eat my meal. The food was awful. The selection was far from ideal. We did 4 flights over a month and each leg was the same.,Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
8,"okay, but nothing great",David Lipshut,Australia,28th September 2015,,"We were in 2 middle seats on the aisle (20F/G). The seats are narrow. I'm not big (170cm) but my elbows could not fit within the width of the seat; I had to use the armrests. This was fine with my wife, but awkward with my other neighbor until they worked out that I was happy with the back of the armrest and they were happy with the front. The distance to the seat in front is not great, but allows for things in the seat pocket without hitting them with your knees. If the person in front reclines a little, all is okay. But, if they recline as far as the seat goes - well, there's just no way you can eat or lean forward to read. Overall, okay, but nothing great.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200ER,3x4x3
6,the seat had ample legroom ,Shehryar Awan,Pakistan,17th September 2015,,"ISB-DXB and DXB-ISB. The outbound flight was excellent, with the new Y seats, the seat had ample legroom and a great recline. For a short 3 hour flight, this was the perfect Economy class. The return was something different. We got the old cabin, and as soon as I sat down, the difference was felt. The legroom was limited, the IFE was not working. My seat covers were torn and worse, the seat didn't recline due to the plane being so old. I got broken, sub-standard earphones, which I attempted to use on the seat next to me, but was surprised to find the whole row TV's were inactive.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
10,spacious cabin and seats on A380,J Tinning,Australia,14th September 2015,,Spacious cabin and seats on this Emirates A380. Power for devices available and good seat pitch with recline. It feels more roomy towards the far aft of the Airbus - rows 80-88 are most spacious in comparison to further forwards of the main deck.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
10,a lot of leg room and space,J Tinning,Australia,14th September 2015,,"Good seating on Emirates Boeing 777-200LR, a lot of leg room and space. I took row 38, where the cabin narrows and the far left and right sides of the cabin and pairs of seats instead of trios. Definitely was comfortable for the 11 hour section. Power available for USB and main adapters for wall plugs - most countries.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200LR,3x4x3
3,"horrible, very cramped seating",Joan Sharkey,Ireland,10th September 2015,,"Absolutely horrible, very cramped seating and I am only 5'3"" so legroom was ok - but when you are surrounded by large people who try to invade your personal space because you're little, it can get frustrating. I am sure it is just as frustrating for larger people but I found no respect for my personal space, my seat mate was obnoxious. Plane was jam packed, temperature was inconsistent and food was of poor quality. Flight attendants didn't ask passengers to put their seats in the upright position for dinner service. Entertainment system is difficult to use, some functions work with touch screen but others only seem to work with the remote. Lots of movies and tv shows on offer but nothing to write home about. The headphones they supply are useless, bring your own headphones or earbuds. There was trash in my seat pocket and old chewing gum under the armrest. 3 out of 10 because it got me where I needed to go but don't think I'll fly economy with Emirates again.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
7,very basic and bland,A Bull,United Kingdom,18th August 2015,,"Manchester to Dubai to SriLanka return. Each flight was delayed, each flight except final return had delayed landing due to airport being busy. One just circling for 1 hour. The seats were comfortable, good leg room and recline. Food, first meal lukewarm. Very basic and bland. IFE was good but sound not always good. We also were given meal vouchers because of the long wait at Dubai. The delays were tiring, I've been less tired on a 13 hour flight.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777 / A330,3x4x3 & 2x4x2
8,seats were quite comfortable,A Wong,Canada,11th August 2015,,"I boarded the Emirates B777-300ER in July three times, in each case with a new plane, but I saw two different types of seats. Both are 17 inch width seats, which can get quite cramped, however on both versions, the IFE worked very well. Seats were quite comfortable, I was able to sleep reasonably well on them, and I didn't wake up to the unpleasant back pain that I was expecting. The stickers that they provide to tell FAs when to wake passengers up are also a very nice touch. While I like to rest undisturbed on the flight, I almost always worry about missing the in-flight meal.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
3,the service has deteriorated,Dick Sims,Australia,6th August 2015,,"I have traveled between Sydney and Bangkok about 3 or four times a year for the past 10 years and most of the time I fly Emirates. However, since Emirates entered into a code share arrangement with Qantas the service has deteriorated and the benefits associated with skywards membership such as upgrades out of Sydney are not worth bothering about. In addition on my recent trip the check-in staff person added the weight of my carry on bag to the luggage weight (I went to another check-in counter). The Boeing 777 was an older plane and lacked some of the refinements like USB and power but was quite okay.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
4,seat doesn't provide much support,A Thalenfeld,Norway,6th August 2015,,"The Boeing 777-300 that Emirates flies has a 3x4x3 layout which doesn't do wonders to the seat. However, legroom is ok, so that helps. Unfortunately, the seat doesn't provide much support. The benefits are large IFE screen, which is good.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
2,had a very uncomfortable journey,S Wood,United Kingdom,2nd August 2015,,"I flew from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai and return. The second time I have done this particular route. Not only has the standard of the food deteriorated but also the standard of cabin service by Emirates staff.  I felt they had no interest in the passengers at all. On my return journey, when I boarded the plane at KL the young woman in front of me had already fully reclined her seat and it was quite difficult to squeeze into mine. When preparing for take off the stewardess didn't even notice the reclining seat. They really don't check properly. As far as I am concerned when the person in front of you fully reclines their seat they are invading the space of the person sat behind. Because of this I had a very uncomfortable 12 hour journey to Dubai. ",Emirates ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
8,aircraft was clean and tidy,Umair Tanvir,United Kingdom,25th July 2015,,"The aircraft was clean and tidy - inflight entertainment was very good, seating with 3x4x3 layout. The staff were nice but having asked to give a glass of water before takeoff, the staff didnt bother and totally forgotten. ",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
3,not impressed at all,M Haeusler,Australia,25th July 2015,,"Heard a lot of good things about Emirates from other people. Not impressed at all. Flew Melbourne to Singapore return, both flights my husband and I were allocated the 2 middle seats in the row of 4.  Cramped seating. Average food and service.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
8,the service wasn't fantastic,Jon Aindow,United Kingdom,29th May 2015,,Just returned from a 3 week break to Oz Manchester to Brisbane (via Dubai) Sydney to Manchester (Via Dubai). The service wasn't fantastic from all the cabin crew the meals weren't fine dining and improvements can be made but I would recommend Emirates A380 services to others. We sat all 4 legs in 59 ABC in order to have the most stable journey so didn't test the levels down the length of this massive aircraft however what we received was extremely good. I interacted with around 20 flight attendants during these 4 legs and 18 were great it's funny how 2 from 20 will stick out more in my mind. We had an hour circling prior to landing in Dubai due to congestion and then 3 hours later had an hour sat on stand waiting for a slot due to congestion.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
1,ruined by the ignorance of other travellers,J Jinks,United Kingdom,29th May 2015,,Why pay for flights which are totally ruined by the ignorance of other travellers who make full use of their recliner? Is it really acceptable that as soon as you get on a flight you fully recline your seat for the whole journey straight into the face of the traveller behind. Cabin crew do nothing can't see the screen struggling to eat struggle to get out to use the bathroom. This happens every time. Enough either ban the recliner or make them pay more for the space they use up.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
3,shocked with the decline in service,N Radford,United Kingdom,29th May 2015,,BHX-DXB-SIN-BNE return not flown on Emirates since 2010. I was shocked with the decline in the service onboard the food was awful trays were not removed quick enough and the cabin crew in my opinion not attentive enough.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
4,very very disappointed,C Peters,United Kingdom,29th May 2015,,GLA-DXB-BKK First time with Emirates and was looking forward to the flights. Very very disappointed. Squeezed in like sardines on both aircraft making the seats very narrow and ultimately uncomfortable. Travelled on 777-300 numerous times on long haul with a 3x3x3 configuration which was very good - Emirates 3x4x3 is a joke. Again huge letdown with the A380 seating arrangement. Priority seems to be numbers and not passenger comfort with Emirates - just don't get all the hype. Entertainment was great but I would far rather have seat comfort and a bit of room to move around in and an 'average' entertainment system than the other way around. Will use Thai Eva or Qatar next time even though it will cost a little more.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380/BOEING 777,3x4x3
1,not much more room than cheap airline,Paul Nelson,United Kingdom,23rd March 2015,,Not much more room than cheap airline. Thin seat. If in aisle seat and your leg is slightly protruding it will get a whack every time the trolley passes (with no apology).,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
4,cabin crew appeared thoroughly disinterested,Peter Grimshaw,United Kingdom,22nd March 2015,,LHR-DXB-DAR return. On the first leg the cabin crew appeared thoroughly disinterested. When eventually the meal reached Row 76 it was luke warm. The drinks trolley arrived as we were finishing the meal and tea and coffee was not offered. Landing at DXB was delayed for over one hour by a duststorm that we understood had been raging for several days. We boarded the B777 for DXB-DAR on time only to sit on the stand for some two hours whilst other flights were given greater priority to take off in the limited visibility caused by the duststorm. To be fair the flight and service on this leg was quite reasonable once airborne. However we arrived at DAR so late that we had missed our onward flight to ZNZ and had to pay for a replacement and to add to the stress Emirates had opted to leave one of our bags either at LHR or DXB. The return from DAR-DBX was good but the having boarded the A380 at DBX very efficiently the departure from the stand on the DXB-LHR was delayed for an hour due to a medical emergency (obviously not Emirates fault). Once airborne it was again evident that the cabin crew simply cannot cope with the number of passengers a fully loaded A380 and once again service did not match expectations. From past experience Emirates has always warranted its 4 star rating but standards have clearly slipped in recent time and that is no longer the case. We will need to find an alternative airline for our next trip to DAR/ZNZ,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380/BOEING 777,3x4x3
8,most comfortable long haul flight,H Adams,Australia,1st March 2015,,This was the most comfortable long haul flight I've ever taken. Oslo to Dubai. The seats were pleasantly squishy my elbow wasn't jogged when folks walked down the aisle and there was plenty of room between my knees and the back of the chair in front (I'm only 163cm) but there was several inches clearance. My kid could squeeze past me when visiting the toilet rather than me having to get out of the chair. The food was pleasant the staff service was excellent.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
5,seats were poor with little room,R Ford,United Kingdom,25th February 2015,,Six flights from Glasgow to Sydney and back. The seats were poor with little room. The cabin was noisy cramped and the service was poor. To top it off the meals were barely edible. How can you give this airline 4 stars. Thankfully the entertainment system was top notch. next time I will fly long haul from London on the A380 and never again on a Boeing 777 in this configuration.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
9,seat is quite comfortable,C Diehl,Germany,9th February 2015,,MUC-DXB-MUC. Both legs on an aisle seat. Seat is quite comfortable and provides enough support for a 6 to 7 hours trip. IFE has a wide choice of movies and series games and so on. Food is good on both legs two choices of main course available. Crew friendly and spot on drinks served through the flight.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
2,seat has restricted legroom,K Mclernon,United Kingdom,28th January 2015,,Dubai to Dublin - booked in 9.30 for 14.55 flight in hope of getting good seat I was given seat 17A. I found this seat has restricted legroom due to bulkhead. Beside me I had a large gentleman with 6 month baby and a lady on the outside. Before take off I complained to cabin crew who promised to sort out after take of. This and three further requests to be reseated where ignored so I eventually found myself another seat. I found the staff of this flight the worst I have ever flown with.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
5,will never use Emirates again,Helen Monk,United Kingdom,28th January 2015,,Took 4 flights with Emirates over last 3 weeks - all long haul. Every one was late. The service particularly on the A380 was terrible as was the food on every trip. They were so late on both our legs out to Africa via Dubai we missed our domestic flight out of Dar Es Salaam and it cost us another $560 to get on another. Emirates stance is hard luck. We travel extensively and we will never use Emirates again. We hadn't used them for some years as we were not impressed then and had hoped that they had improved - alas they have deteriorated even more.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380/BOEING 777,3x4x3
4,seats very hard with no support,B Avenell,United Kingdom,28th January 2015,,Seats very hard with no support. Probably ok for a short journey but even with extra leg room it was uncomfortable for me as average height on a 7 plus hour journey. We had seat row 80 to our destination and row 51 on the way back.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
2,seat was very uncomfortable,S Ford,Australia,28th January 2015,,Dubai to Melbourne on Qantas codeshare flight. Seat was very uncomfortable and felt like padding was worn down to nothing. Meal service chaotic and seemingly no order to service with people around us bring served and others missed. Ran out of one of the choices and vegetarian meal offered which was in edible. Bread roll on some trays and not others. No hot drink offered. Although a range of entertainment choices nothing much appealed as many were Arabic or Bollywood. Overall not as good as the previous leg of the trip on Qantas. I would not choose Emirates again.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
2,needs to review their seat comfort,M Bari,United States,28th January 2015,,Emirates needs to review their seat comfort. Seats are not comfortable and feel like seating on a plastic chair. Also please increase leg room and seat width.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200,3x4x3
5,full flight was a total nightmare,Philippe Mariame,Ireland,19th November 2014,,Dublin to Dubai after take off the person in front reclined her seat during the whole fight till the breakfast time. During diner time I asked the air hostess to ask the lady to put her seat straight so I could eat my meal properly she said she cannot do that. So during the full flight it was a total nightmare. They tea/coffee tray after meal never show up after 45mins I ended up asking for a tea. I used to travel with Emirates before and I was always happy - but this time no tonic drink no tea till you ask and recline seat during all flight that enough for me.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
1,no space to move,A Henry,United Kingdom,19th November 2014,,Seated at the end of a 4 seat row. Each time food trolley came up I was bumped on shoulder. Also had water spilled by stewardess on me. People queuing for toilet standing in front of me. Not pleasant with just a wall in front of me. Everything too restricting no space to move. Also didn't get seat I had booked as someone at Dubai airport when I presented boarding pass changed my seat without saying!! And where are smiles these days. Not a good flight.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
2,no baby meals provided,S Holland,Australia,19th November 2014,,Bassinet seat. No baby seatbelt provided until we has started leaving the gate. No baby meals provided on 8hr flight DXB-MAN. Bassinet position meant it was impossible for me positioned by window to exit my seat without crawling under the bassinet as no room in front of seats. Entertainment system very good. Oriental meal consisted of coleslaw sandwich. No obvious flight attendant care as passenger walking around cabin just prior to landing. Free strollers from gate to baggage claim. Would not recommend for travelling with babies and infants.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
2,cushioning was non existent,J Burke,Australia,19th November 2014,,I am under 5' and thin. The seat recline button was broken/pushed in and did not recline. The passenger in the seat in front of me had their seat in the reclined position the entire flight from Melbourne to Dubai. The pain from sitting upright was unbearable. My back neck hips and bottom was that bad I put my blanket under my bottom just to relive the pain. It did not help. The cushioning was non existent and I am a petite person. Emirates in conjunction with Qantas pride themselves with their fleet. I was totally stressed out from not having any rest. I could not watch the seat back monitor as it was too close and getting out from my seat was difficult due to the seat in front of me being reclined. I have had many long haul flights but I would have to say this was the worst and most memorable.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
1,Emirates customer review,B Palmer,New Zealand,19th November 2014,,Very hard firm straight back seat with headrest positioned about shoulder blades and wouldn't shift. No lumbar support simply awful. Like sitting on a wooden backed dining chair with minimal padding. Fortunately only in it for 3.5 hours wouldn't have wanted to do long haul e.g. Brisbane/Dubai in it. Suffering made longer by plane having wrong waypoints laid in and spending a lot of the flight heading towards Sydney not Brisbane.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
3,the seats were so close,C Vickers,Australia,19th November 2014,,We returned home 3 days ago flying from Venice to Dubai in 777. My husband is tall so we had asked for exit seats After arriving at the airport early (at 5.30 am in the hope of getting an exit seat) for a 10.10am flight. We were told sorry but all exit seats had already been reserved for Melbourne travellers (we are from NZ). The flight to Dubai was an horrendous 6 hours the seats were so close and five minutes into the flight while we were still climbing the woman and man in front of us put their seats back! It was a hell ride one we wont be repeating.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
8,staff attentive and polite,Murray Nettheim,Australia,19th November 2014,,Sydney-Dubai-Sydney. Staff attentive and polite. WiFi you get 10MB free and pay $1US for an additional 10MB. It took me some time to connect but once I did was all good. Food quality is very good unfortunately not much variety. Entertainment was great - the earphones were not good and were quickly replaced.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
1,3x4x3 configuration is too tight,Ralston Grose,Australia,16th July 2014,,"Emirates have tried to squeeze the last drop out of the orange in their economy seats and seating plan in their B777. The 3x4x3 configuration is too tight for this aircraft and makes the aisle just wide enough for the food cart. If in any aisle seat you will be hit every time they come past. The seat width and legroom is fine if you are an 8 year old child but for someone who is 6"" 1' it is not a pleasurable experience.",Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
5,really dislike this configuration,Gabriel Low,Singapore,3rd March 2014,,I was disappointed with the 3x4x3 configuration on the aircraft. The services provided by the crew was pleasant the PTV was nice but what is bothering me the most are the seat width and access in/out of the seat. The seat width was really narrow and basically you would make contact with the passenger beside you all the time. And accessing in/out of the seat will disturb the passenger beside you which probably both of you will need to stand up for you to access out/in. The aisles are also narrow due to the 3x4x3 configuration. I really dislike this configuration.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
2,very narrow seats and aisles,Gerald Mackay,United Kingdom,3rd March 2014,,Very narrow seats and aisles. Very uncomfortable if your neighbour is large. In the aisle seat you are continually knocked by staff passing up and down aisle. The good legroom is gained by reducing the cushioning on the seat so they soon become uncomfortable on a long flight. and if the person in front reclines the seat the advantage of the legroom is sacrificed.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
8,the seats are comfortable,F Koenig,Germany,3rd March 2014,,Legroom is good and the seats are comfortable.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
5,drink service was efficient,P Smith,Australia,29th January 2014,,Auckland to Brisbane. We had chosen seats 52J and 52K bulkhead seats in the first row of the second economy class cabin which did offer more leg room. They are located next to the galley so you get a lot of noise from that area. This did not bother me at all but on a much longer flight if you wanted to sleep may have been a bad choice. The hot towels were very welcome and also the drink service was efficient. When the evening meal was served we seemed to wait ages for the cart to appear at our row. We were offered the choice offered on the menu of Beef or Salmon and then immediately told the Salmon had run out some time ago. Then why offer it? Our row was not offered tea or coffee during the meal service. Just prior to landing the female flight attendant decided to tidy her hair and apply make-up in the galley mirror which took some time she should have done this out of sight of passengers. I think Singapore and Thai in my opinion offer much more for economy passengers.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
2,we were so disappointed,Uwe Peiter,Germany,24th January 2014,,I am 175 cm tall and weight 78 kg. FRA via DXB to PER and back. Seat comfort is comparable to a cheap charter airline. I cannot understand how Emirates has such a good performance rating. We were so disappointed to Emirates because of the service and the quality of seating. I am sure we will choose for our next longhaul flight SIA again. SIA and THAI has a better Service and better seating comfort.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
2,most uncomfortable journey I have made,S North,United States,22nd January 2014,,"I have made many long haul flights out of Washington DC including some 17 hour flights to Narita Japan but this 14 hour flight was by far the worst and most uncomfortable journey I have ever made. I usually get up frequently to help with leg swelling but sitting in the middle of the 4 pack of seats was nearly impossible getting out even for me as a 5'7"" thin build woman. General back pain and discomfort for the entire flight. I wish I could say the entertainment made up for it but it was in no way worth it over other comparative flying experiences I have had on airlines like British Airways and Qatar. I was generally looking forward to flying Emirates after hearing great things but do your body a favor and avoid this economy flight if at all possible.",Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
1,economy seats are totally uncomfortable,Nina Smith,United Kingdom,17th January 2014,,I really don't know how all the other airlines have much more space than this one. First of all how can they be number 1 airline when economy seats are totally uncomfortable? Configuration 3x4x3 is too much because as a passenger you don't have enough space and also for cabin crew who are struggling to pass with all service trolleys. Also between the services you need to be careful not to be hit by cart on - knee leg or shoulder. As someone mentioned before it's so poor ambience when you see full cabin with all the luggage bags and poor cabin crew who don't have space for all this stuff. What are they willing to do just to have more money?,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
7,good food and decent entertainment,M Drenic,Thailand,13th January 2014,,The A380 is great and Economy class BKK - Hong Kong is really acceptable. Good food and decent entertainment but they didn't offer wine and passengers didn't know you had to ask for it. The one thing I didn't like was the quality of the headphones and the background hiss was awful however I also have a hearing problem but this was terrible. I ended up watching a film on the laptop.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
5,head is pressed forward,D Knuth,Spain,10th January 2014,,We flew with A380. The seats with this headrest behind your head is a disaster. Your head is pressed forward all the time - many people were complaining about this. You cannot sit relaxed with your head to the back like in the normal Boeing.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
8,had enough space,Kilian Osterhammer,Germany,6th January 2014,,"It was my first flight with Emirates and with an A380 and I (192m) had enough space for my long legs which is not usual in economy-class when you are tall. While I slept my legs touched the seat in front of me but I'm used to that. People of ""normal"" size shouldn't have problems with the space. The TV-Screen and the entertainment system was very good and had a large choice of movies and music.",Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
2,seats are not wide enough,Glenn Ainscough,United Kingdom,6th January 2014,,The seats are not wide enough at all the return flight my backside started to ache as 7 hrs is a long flight on uncomfortable seats. TV is OK but the system is dated on the 777 and was a bit grubby. I flew on 3 of these and only one had a nice TV on the other hand the A380 was much more comfortable and a much better flight I guess because of the added room.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
4,deeply uncomfortable and unsafe,Kim Chance,Australia,6th January 2014,,"The 3x4x3 seat configuration in a 777 is deeply uncomfortable and unsafe. I am not an unusual build for a western male at 6'2"" and 110 kilograms but I cannot get into anything but an aisle seat where the aisle is so narrow that cabin staff have to ask me to move my upper body across the neighbouring passenger so they can get their trolleys past me. The risk of having scalding water spilt all over me while they are serving coffee is always there and it does happen although not to me yet. I understand Qatar have a 3x3x3 configuration I think that is my next airline.",Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
4,seat was narrow,R West,Thailand,6th January 2014,,Seat was narrow as many other people have mentioned. Legroom was okay but I was never comfortable - fortunately my flight was only 7 hours (MEL-SIN). The squab seems to move when the seat is reclined meaning most people didn't try to recline their seats - which helped with room for the knees.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
8,good seat was able to sleep,W van Hal,Netherlands,6th January 2014,,Good seat was able to sleep. The bottom half moves forward when the back is reclined offering better comfort.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
2,flight is truly miserable,Ian Pavey,Australia,24th October 2013,,The Boeing 777 was not designed for 3x4x3 seating. It's horrible and if you have the misfortune to be seated next to a larger person your 11 hour flight is truly miserable. Never again - Qatar for me from now on.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
2,horrible cushioning,Tze Lim,Australia,24th October 2013,,All good except for the horrible cushioning. I had to tuck 3 pillows under me for the entire 7 hour flight.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
4,narrow seat and aisles,N Jeram,Australia,24th October 2013,,First time on a B777-300ER. Seat 45C was the last seat before the rows with two seats started. Good recline (no one behind) but narrow seat and aisles are way too narrow so bumped constantly. Noisier than A380 so a long way (DBX-SYD) to put up with discomfort.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
8,did not seem overly cramped,C Hartwell,United Kingdom,24th October 2013,,Manchester to Dubai. There were 3 of us travelling (2 adults and a 5 year old) and we had 3 of the centre 4 seats. Row 36 had a wall behind it but the seat seemed to fully recline and we could store pillows etc behind the seat and no one could kick us. We were close to the galley and toilet but that did not bother us. The seat had the new ICE which was fantastic with a huge range of movies tv shows and music and widescreen monitor. We were not bothered by the 4 seats in the middle it did not seem overly cramped and the lack of a footrest was fine. The recline was very good seat comfortable and I was able to stretch my legs under the seat in front. I am 5'11 and 15 stones. The food was very good and good choice of drinks.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
4,always very uncomfortable,Bharathi Raja,India,20th April 2013,,I travelled quite a few times in B777-300ER from DXB-GRU Flight time is around 14 hours. It is always very uncomfortable to seated in 3x4x3 configuration as compared to Qatar airways 3x3x3 configuration. Sadly Emirates sacrifices the economy passengers comfort for higher revenue per seat.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
2,seats were not comfortable,Ashutosh Garg,India,20th April 2013,,DEL-DXB-DEL A330s are the oldest aircraft in emirates fleet. Seats were not comfortable and meals served were just above average. Both flights were on time but staff was rude at delhi airport. Will prefer not to fly again.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A330,2x4x2
3,difficult to get in and out,A Kamarulzaman,Singapore,20th April 2013,,Extremely difficult to get in and out if you are sitting not beside the aisle. Situation gets worse if you get a fairly big size passenger. Consolation was the in flight entertainment.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
8,bulk head seats were excellent,K Hunt,New Zealand,20th April 2013,,I flew Auckland to London with a 9 month old and I thought cabin crew and bulk head seats were excellent. I was nervous about flying on my own with a baby but had no problems. The passengers I sat next to we're very friendly and helpful which was a godsend. A380's have great space if you need to stretch your legs (this is compared to other planes you are still in a plane you're not going to be able to jog around). Food nice entertainment looked excellent seats were hard so had to try and work it a comfy position. Probably impossible. They weren't worse than a lot of other airlines. Didn't like Dubai airport - so busy and airside hotel not open in the A380 terminal and after asking unhelpful customer services how I could get to the other terminals I only had an hour and they only had smoking rooms.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
7,feeling of a bit more privacy,Jeremy Little,United States,20th April 2013,,"Flew IAD-DXB in 28A and then DXB-IAD in 46K. The reviews you will read about the 2x4x2 section at the very rear of the aircraft are true. 46K had more legroom space between the seat and the window and an overall feeling of a bit more privacy. The cons to 46K are that the armrest between 46J and K is a permanent one that cannot be raised or lowered. This might have eaten into the already slim seat width a bit but it did not bother me being 5'8"" and average size. Another con to being at the very back of the plane is that it takes a long time to deplane and they were out of the meal I wanted by the time they got to me. 28A was just fine but only because there was no one in the middle seat next to me. Originally there was and after the doors we closed the FA came and found him an aisle seat to move to. Before he moved however I was already sore from leaning against the window just so our shoulders wouldn't touch. Had he stayed there the entire 13.5 hr flight that would have been terrible. The 3x4x3 layout overall is a bad idea for passenger comfort. Not only are the seats shoulder- touchingly narrow but the other comments you've read about the aisle width are very true. I had to sidestep down the aisles to try and avoid bumping other passengers. And at meal/drink service time? Forget it. I did not have a problem with the lack of a footrest as some have commented. Sure it would have been nice to have but my feet touched the floor just fine and I'm 5'8"". If this is a problem for you I'd suggest using your carry on or as I read in a different forum bring a beach ball with you. When not inflated it takes up almost no room it costs $1 and if you partially inflate it it won't roll and makes a good makeshift footrest.",Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
9,so seating is now 2-4-2,Alan Punter,United Kingdom,20th April 2013,,Seats 46A-B 46J-K and the same in row 47 are good seats on the B777. This is where the plane narrows so seating is now 2-4-2. There are 4 rows with 2 seats left and right but the best seats are row 46/47 you are far enough away from the toilets not to be bothered by pax queuing.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
3,just perpetually uncomfortable,A Muir,United Kingdom,15th February 2013,,Just perpetually uncomfortable. I am a male 6' and of average height. The only thing that makes Emirates economy class bearable is the entertainment. We're looking to fly to New Zealand next year and trawling the airlines to fly virtually anyone except Emirates.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
1,there are no foot rests,Neil Henshall,United Kingdom,22nd January 2013,,The seat goes up at the front and I had to take off my shoes and put my feet on them to avoid cutting the blood circulation. My wife put her feet on top of her handbag. There are no foot rests. I have another flight prebooked with Emirates but after that I will not use Emirates again. I have no idea what size person you would have to be to be comfortable on one of their planes.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
8,seats were decent enough,Hanafi Ali,Singapore,10th January 2013,,The seats were decent enough for my liking. Not the best in the world or anything like that. Besides I didn't really care all that much. I cared more about the legroom and head rest.The head room leaves much to be desired though.,Emirates ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3
1,made the journey almost unbearable,Joanna Beeson,United States,1st January 2013,,I flew Emirates for the first time and this will be my last time on the 777-300 with their seat configuration of adding the extra seat to each row in economy. You could not walk down the aisle without bumping into some poor person sitting in the aisle seat. Which is probably your best seat if you don't want to feel too closed in. The narrow seats made the journey almost unbearable. I flew the 14 hour leg from Houston to Dubai then 10 hours to Perth Australia. The seats were just way to uncomfortable narrow and very little seat cushioning. I will return my loyal patronage back to Qantas for my USA - Australia hauls!,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
2,seat layout horrific,Anne Billington,United Kingdom,22nd October 2011,,B777-300 3x4x3 seat layout horrific. No leg room very narrow seats. No footrests unable to recline chair due to pain in thighs. Pain in shoulders from leaning to left into window to avoid person in middle. This seating configuration would only be bearable for a short haul flight. 6.5 hours MRU-DXB very uncomfortable. Terrible swelling in feet and ankles. Very difficult to get out of seats. Unfortunate pax in middle has nowhere to go and has to use armrests unless they want to sit with their arms above their head. As soon as person in front reclines their seat you get cross eyes from trying to watch the IFE from a distance of around 3 inches.,Emirates ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
2,no assistance from staff,Sergey Porokh,Australia,22nd October 2011,,Seats designed for sitting with infants on laps were assigned to people without any infants whereas people with infants had ordinary legroom seats. There was no assistance from staff to sort it out. Do not recommend Emirates for those who travel with infants since bassinet seats are not guaranteed/reserved.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
1,have never been so uncomfortable,A Dennett,South Africa,28th July 2011,,I'm short but wide and I have never been so uncomfortable in my life - eventually had to put the arm rest up just to breathe! When the seat is reclined your feet don't touch the floor and this makes it even more uncomfortable - worst flight of my life!,Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200LR,3x4x3
2,the worst flight I've ever flown,A Hales,United States,12th June 2011,,Dubai to Kuala Lumpur and had never seen a B777 with 3x4x3 configuration in economy class. It was without a doubt the worst flight I've ever flown as far as comfort. The flight was about 6 hours long. I thought Emirates was a top class airline. I was disappointed that they preferred to pack people in rather than aim for the comfort of its passengers. I requested an aisle seat and even the trolleys could hardly manage to make it through the aisles. Everyone had to walk sideways. I was hit and jostled constantly by people coming through (they could not help it). I am 1m73 and felt the seat already on my knees. When the person reclined it was even more uncomfortable. I spent most of the flight standing up rather than sitting in that uncomfortable seat. To make matters worse there was the video for the row in front of me on the floor where I should have been able to put my feet (the row in front was the exit row) so I could not even fully extend my legs! This was the first time and I hope the last time to fly Emirates.,Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3
3,unimpressed with the width,Jim Greenshields,Australia,12th June 2011,,We deliberately chose seats at the rear of the plane (47A/B) so we had more aisle space but we were unimpressed with the width of the seat the unforgivable lack of a footrest and the hardness of the seat. We are not seasoned travellers by any means but we expect a lot better than we got. We won't be using Emirates again.,Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
8,seat was comfortable enough,A Tjokrosaputro,Indonesia,9th June 2011,,The seat was comfortable enough at least more comfortable than that of Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
8,A380 is not perfect,Ian Wade,United Kingdom,18th May 2011,,I prefer seats in the 777-300ER as I find them to be softer than the A380 and don't require the extra width offered on the bigger plane. A380 is not perfect but sitting anywhere for 14 hours isn't going to be a great experience. The best seats are at the back of A380 ideally the row ahead of the crew sleeping section as they can be reclined without inconveniencing those behind you close proximity to the single rear toilet - if you're bored the crew often congregate at the rear and up for a chat.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A380-800,3x4x3
8,found seats on A380 comfortable,Boris Orenic,Slovakia,6th April 2011,,I am 186 cm tall and found seats on A380 comfortable. Leg room is bigger compared to other Emirates aircraft and seat width is ok.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
8,seats are wider better legroom,D Felton,United Kingdom,6th April 2011,,Although seating is still 3-4-3 in the new A380’s the seats are wider better legroom and superior than B777-300ER aircraft in their fleet.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
1,the most uncomfortable seat,Christina Moulinie,United Kingdom,5th April 2011,,This was the most uncomfortable seat I have ever encountered on an aircraft the seat itself was ok but as there was no footrest my feet did not touch the ground so I had to plie up cushions and wrap them in the blanket to put under my feet this was not ideal as the pains in my legs and feet spoiled the first few days of our holiday.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A340-500,2x4x2
2,seats were horrible,Henry Choo,Australia,5th April 2011,,The seats were horrible because when you recline the seats rises up and leave your feet dangling without a footrest. I complained to the flight-attendant and she told me yes she also finds it very uncomfortable as they took out all the footrests. For long haul flights you will get cramp and leg soreness without footrest. I will never fly Emirates again.,Emirates ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
1,felt cramped like sardines,F Collins,United Kingdom,7th January 2011,,Appalled at the 3x4x3 configuration in Economy class flying from Dubai to Perth. Felt cramped like sardines and claustrophobic and one of the most uncomfortable flights I've ever taken. Other passengers commented on poor conditions. I will not fly them again. Most other airlines would only have a 3x3x3 config in Economy on this type of aircraft or similar.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-200,3x4x3
4,10 abreast seating in Y class,Sean Redmond,Saudi Arabia,15th December 2010,,I think it's pretty poor for a non-charter airline to have 10 abreast seating in Y class on a 777. Even Saudia has now taken the cheap move of adding an extra seat in the 777 Y cabin!,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
1,horrifically uncomfortable pain,Linda Bradley,South Africa,22nd October 2010,,Lack of footrests causing the most horrifically uncomfortable pain in the back of the thighs. Severe swelling in ankles and legs for days after. You can't do in-flight exercises and walking up & down the aisle for 8 hours. Requested a plastic foot rest for the return flight - not available !,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
2,seats were very narrow,R Rose,Australia,21st September 2010,,The seats were very narrow and very uncomfortable for the long haul flight from Dubai to Brisbane. Felt like we were packed in a sardine can. Not recommended.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
2,terrible pain in the back of your thighs,Lee Barnes,United Kingdom,6th September 2010,,The seat gives you a terrible pain in the back of your thighs due to the foot rest been removed. I could not get comfortable on either sectors of my journey and found the only way around this was to sit upright. The meal tray does not slide towards you like on some other airlines which means you find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat. Big improvements are needed for this aircraft.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
2,extremely narrow seats,John Broussard,United States,7th August 2010,,I don't like that you can't get your seat assigned on some legs (Dubai-Houston) until checking in. The 3-4-3 seat arrangement in Economy makes for extremely narrow seats which create an uncomfortable flight experience. Sitting in an aisle seat means your shoulder will be banged repeatedly by anyone walking by or by passing carts. It is reason to fly another airline.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777,3x4x3
1,legroom was not too bad,Gill Ashton,Australia,17th July 2010,,Flying Emirates was the most uncomfortable flight we have ever done. I was expecting the seat to be narrow but the width was OK. Legroom was not too bad but my legs dangled in mid-air the entire time with horrible discomfort under the lower thighs. Also the seating is incredibly hard and unyielding just couldn't get my head comfortable and my shoulders and neck still ache 3 days post-flight. We could not sleep on the Dubai-Perth leg as the people behind found the legroom too short and kept pushing our seats back whenever we reclined them. Terribly uncomfortable we will never fly with them again.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300/A380/A345,2x4x2
1,seats are excruciatingly uncomfortable,John Cooke,Australia,2nd July 2010,,Do not travel on these Emirates aircraft. The seats are excruciatingly uncomfortable as the footrests have been removed. This causes pressure behind the lower thighs since there is no other leg support. It is virtually impossible to get comfortable. After 16 hours I was exhausted. Many passengers complained - response from Emirates has been disappointing.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A340-500,2x4x2
2,poor legroom poor width poor armrests,Karen Morgan,United Kingdom,30th June 2010,,Seats 35 E/F on A330 - awful seats. I would recommend that others avoid these seats - poor legroom poor width poor armrests.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A330-200,2x4x2
6,seats are too narrow,Roger Lyon,United Kingdom,6th June 2010,,Seats are too narrow and has been said many times the configuration means narrow aisles.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300ER,3x4x3
2,seat width was terrible,Clive Baldwin,United Kingdom,26th May 2010,,I had an aisle seat but was totally cramped seat width was terrible I was struck on the shoulder quite violently by passing trolleys more than four times. My knees touched the seat in front and of course the person in front reclined his seat making the screen virtually unviewable and the meals tray inaccessible.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300ER,3x4x3
4,lack of a footrest made it uncomfortable,R Rajan,Philippines,26th May 2010,,The lack of a footrest made it uncomfortable even for a tall guy like me. I am lean but I think these seats will be uncomfortable for a stocky person. The 3x4x3 is a bad idea for long haul economy flights (mine was a 9 hour flight) - you end up feeling like really being packed in a can of sardines. The service wasn't the best either.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300ER,3x4x3
3,no footrests makes it even worse,Ravitej Goteti,Canada,31st December 2009,,Terrible experience flying from DXB into JFK. They need to re-work their seating configuration or their seating dimensions. No footrests makes it even worse.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-200ER,3x4x3
5,seats are far too cramped,A Fareed,Saudi Arabia,4th December 2009,,The seats are far too cramped for my liking and seat configuration on long-haul flights is terrible.. Like most other reviewers I would say they should put the foot rest back! Also the seats could be a little softer!,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
7,the seat cushions are quite firm,David Russell,United Kingdom,10th November 2009,,Economy seat at back of cabin where layout is 2x4x2. I am over 1.9m tall and had no problem on the flight from LHR to DXB. If there was a criticism it was that the seat cushions are quite firm.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
8,wide and comfortable seat,Anders Rundgren,Sweden,10th October 2009,,Wide and comfortable seat. For a 1.86 tall person like me it's usually a must to get exit or bulkhead seat but on the A380 it felt good even on a normal seat.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
1,the most uncomfortable seat,Paul Turner,New Zealand,15th June 2009,,Has to be the most uncomfortable seat I have ever sat in on a plane. Looking at other reviews it appears that the removal of foot rests is the cause of the problem. Inflight entertainment system was excellent.,Emirates ,Economy Class,A340-500,2x4x2
2,terribly uncomfortable seat,Chris Rayner,United Kingdom,3rd March 2009,,Terribly uncomfortable seat. The airline has taken out the footrests for which the seat was designed. The result is that your feet hang in mid air in any position except bolt upright. Trying to doze is rewarded by pain in the backs of your thighs from the pressure from the seat. Avoid at all costs,Emirates ,Economy Class,A340,2x4x2
1,the most uncomfortable of any airline,R Pickavance,New Zealand,2nd March 2009,,"I've flown Emirates for many years now and I'm just about to switch allegiances. My work demands I travel extensively on long haul every year (last year 13 return flights from NZ to the Middle East Asia and the US) and the recent decision by Emirates to remove the seat rests has now made the seats the most uncomfortable of any airline I travel with. I can't over-emphasize how uncomfortable these seats are (I'm 5'10"").",Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x4x3
4,reduces a lot of seat comfort,Emmanuel Makris,Greece,7th February 2009,,The problem starts with the 3-4-3 seat configuration in all B777's by adding an extra seat to the normal 3-3-3 configuration. That reduces a lot of seat comfort and legroom. If the flight is 7 or 8 hours then you have a big problem. By the end of the flight you feel so tired and your feet pain for at least two days.,Emirates ,Economy Class,B777-300ER,3x4x3
6,good compromise for tall people,Juan Venegas,Ireland,19th August 2021,1," Small legroom like most European airlines, but not that bad for tall people, this is because although the legroom is small, the seats don't recline, and for tall people, at least for me is a big plus, because once the seats in front of you recline, the legroom is completely gone. With Ryanair you are guaranteed that the person in front if you will not recline the seat, and since Ryanair trips are not long haul, I'd say its a good compromise for tall people.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
4,seat cushion  lacks support,A Wong,Canada,25th November 2019,1," 
Review of the older Ryanair seat: No seatback pocket, no adjustable headrest, and no recline. The seat cushion also lacks support, causing numbness after sitting there for 2 hours. Cabin hygiene was more or less passable, but those seats do make storage a little awkward due to the lack of an intermediate storage space when you begin to put things away. That being said, it does give you a little extra leg room, which would matter for taller people. The seats are obviously quite narrow, and legroom is more cramped, but being 5’8, I had more than enough leg room.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
1,Seats are very uncomfortable,Gianluca Foggia,Spain,14th November 2019,1," Seats are very uncomfortable, had neck pain pain for 2 days after the trip. They assigned me a random seat obviously the worst I can get just because I didn't pay extras.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
3, paid extra for the front row of seats,Robert Rawson,United Kingdom,6th November 2019,0, Ryanair is renowned for cheap flights and if booked well in advance my return from Manchester to Gran Canaria was £42. I bought 2 tickets and paid extra for the front row of seats having loads of leg room and priority boarding etc. The bill went from £84 to £269 for the 2 of us. On boarding at Manchester the cabin crew had sat somebody in our seats and made us sit us regular seats. I explained I had paid a lot of money for those seats to refused to sit there. I contacted Ryanair to have their T and C quoted to me that they can move people if for safety and security and would not get a refund. In all it’s a waste of money and customers service is outweighed by greed. I agree you get what you pay for but I paid and didn’t get anything of the sort.,Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3
7,worth paying for this seat,D Marson,United States,20th May 2019,1, Seat 17D in the emergency exit row. Lots of legroom and priority boarding. Seats in the emergency exit row on this aircraft are narrower than other seats because the tray table stows in the armrest. It's still worth paying for this seat to get the extra legroom if you're tall. I think the seats may be made of vinyl and the back support is not that great but it's okay for short flights.,Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
3,no no for people over 1.85 meters,E Gartios,Greece,17th May 2019,1, This airline is a no no for people over 1.85 meters in Height. I am something taller than that and I had trouble fitting my knees straight. They do inform you with seat space but it is a marketing trick that they don't say you can't fit if you are above a certain height. 3/10 just cause it's super cheap,Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
1,Seats too small,Mahmoud Mohanna,Canada,11th May 2019,1," Seats too small, tidy, almost no leg space. No screen, No flight tracking, No free entertainment, No free water, No free food, No free snacks. Very small space for your baggage in the cabin. ",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
2,recline of seat very uncomfortable,Dominique Nguyen,Germany,12th August 2018,0," This was my first flight with Ryanair from Düsseldorf-Weeze to Pisa. Since I am not a really tall person and normally thin, the seat width and legroom was okay for me. I've expected worse. But the recline of the seat was very uncomfortable. It's not enjoyable sitting in there for two hours. The aisle space was nothing special and acceptable. TV-Screens, seat pockets and seat power supply are non-existent. In the end I wouldn't recommend this airline. You get what you pay for but I'd rather pay a bit more for a healthy back.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
2,uncomfortable with no recline,Laura Atkins,Israel,24th December 2017,1," Ryanair's randomly allocated seating policy is such a mess. Any other airline allows you to sit with your family if there is room. Ryanair forces you to sit separately unless you pay an additional 10-18 euro per person per direction. All this does is creates chaos when everyone tries to swap their seats around during boarding. I sat in row 33 while my husband sat in row 9. Upon disembarking most families, ourselves included couldn't easily find each other and this in turn caused more confusion in the passport line. The seats themselves are typical of a low budget airline, thin and uncomfortable with no recline.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
1,con you out of money to sit together,C Hannen,United Kingdom,29th November 2017,1," I’ve just checked in with Ryanair for the two of us and have selected their “Free” random seating, I have been given a seat in row 10 and my partner a seat in row 22! When I then try to go and change the seats the seats either side of us on each row are free and we can sit next to each other for a fee. Why could the random seating not seat us together when there are all these two seats together which are free? Oh, it’s because Ryanair want to con you out of more money to sit together! Not even your your children are safe from this con as you have to pay to sit next to them. No other airline has stooped as low as Ryanair! Also if you decide to sit next to a loved one the cost of the seat is considerably higher than if you sit say 2-3 rows behind, so they even increase the seat fee to sit right next to them, Ryanair you have no morels! I would suggest that you definitely do not pay the fee con and instead on boarding the aircraft during boarding stand in the aisles and ask other passengers with the same problem as there are many to try and swap with you, as there will be lots of you doing this it will slow down the boarding and cause issues for Ryanair but why should you care? It is Ryanair that has changed their seating process and caused you more stress so this is how we now have to sort it out!",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
1,purposely allocate seats apart,Derek Loveday,Spain,17th November 2017,, We flew from Leeds to Alicante. I checked in on line 3 minutes after it opened. I did not wish to pre purchase seats as we had just paid £69.99 for each seat.They allocated 15E for me & 28E for my wife. When I was seated there was the window seat next to me & the window seat on the opposite row both vacant. I have emailed Ryan air 3 times now suggesting that their policy has changed & they purposely allocate seats apart so you will pay the extra money. They have replied but not answered the seat allocation problem. We fly to the Uk about every 6 weeks but no more with this airline.,Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3
1,most uncomfortable flying experience,Ben Kirby,United Kingdom,7th August 2017,," Absolutely terrible. I'm 6'4"" and even on an aisle seat, I couldn't fit my knees behind the seat in front. The seats don't recline at all either, the cushions are rock hard and the upholstery is so slippery that you slip down all the time. By far in a way the most uncomfortable flying experience I've ever had. Will never use them again.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3
1,you are deliberately separated,Jane Quarmby,United Kingdom,23rd July 2017,,"❎ Unverified |  The worst airline I have ever flown with. What kind of customer service is it when you are deliberately separated from the person you are travelling with. My partner and I recently travelled from Manchester to Krakow and desite checking in at the earliest possible time on the outbound flight I was right at the back sandwiched between two random people and my partner was right at the front. On our return flight despite an empty seat next to me I was at the front and my partner at the back. This is supposed to be random there is nothing random about it, this is deliberate. I am only 5 foot 2 inches in height and as you can imagine trying to get my luggage into the hold is difficult for me I rely on my partner to help me. Of course no cabin staff was available to ask and had to embarrassingly ask another passenger for assistance. Apart from that no other complaints but why cant Ryanair just be nice to their customers not only that by splitting people up causes disruption boarding and unboarding the plane and as a result on our outward flight we missed our flight slot for take off due to passengers taking longer to board.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3
1,squashed and uncomfortable,Yvonne Christina,United Kingdom,25th April 2017,,"❎ Unverified |  I hadn't flown Ryanair for a good number of years and had forgotten how dire the experience was. The seats are so squashed and uncomfortable you can barely move and because you can't recline the seat or have any leg room to stretch out you can't even look out of the windows in a window seat! I got back ache on holiday because of the uncomfortable flight. Then there's that horrible yellow interior, just dreadful.  I'm in my 40s now and realise that a bit of comfort when travelling is worth paying for.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3
3,no luggage space over this row,R Arab,Poland,31st December 2015,,"I took two flights with Ryanair in a week, first from Warsaw to Tenerife and then from Tenerife to Linz, and I was assigned to the seat 33A on both flights. The seat is the very last one in the corner. The legroom does not differ significantly from the others on any Ryanair aircraft. Nor do any seats recline at all. The main problem, I suppose, is that there are no luggage space over this row (33) on their aircraft. Besides, it sometimes happens that the smell from the toilets come to the cabin. For example, it did happen on the second flight to Linz.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
5,no real problems with leg room,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,21st November 2015,,"Have no real problems with Ryanair leg room or seat width (unless someone large is sitting beside me) as both my wife and myself are under 5ft 8ins. Also am glad that the seats do not recline as I have travelled on charter flights in the past almost pinned in my seat by the reclined seat in front. However, neither my wife and I are keen on Ryanair's so-called leather seats, as we find that after a couple of hours we start to stick to them and they become increasingly uncomfortable. The absence of a seat pocket is a mixed blessing: while there is nowhere to store the things one wants to be at hand on the flight, at least you don't get banged in the back by the person behind fumbling in his / her seat pocket.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800 ,3x3
7,not the comfiest of seats,Theo Skagias,Greece,3rd November 2015,,Not the comfiest of seats. However I like the fact that there is no reclining option for the passenger in front to make your trip more uncomfortable. Good option,Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
2,knees jammed into my back,Ruth Rowe,United Kingdom,23rd October 2015,,"Adjustable airline seats cause too many problems with a thoughtless passenger reclining his/her seat so much that they are almost lying on the person behind them. However the Ryanair legroom is far too small. I am a small person (5'3"") but my knees are up to the seat in front. On my last flight I had a guy of about 6'1"" behind me and his knees were constantly jammed into my back. He could not help it. There should be a seat 'area' that all planes and all airlines have to use.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3
1,feel very uncomfortable,Antonios Kouroutsavouris,Philippines,21st October 2015,,"Seats are too close and uncomfortable, you cannot move them front or back, you must seat like a soldier standing still. Even in sort flights you feel very uncomfortable on those seats.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
6,not enough legroom,G Papandreou,Greece,11th August 2015,,"Average seats with no recline mechanism, not enough legroom and width for a tall or wider person.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3
1,seats are hard and uncomfortable,Dan Fisher,United Kingdom,2nd August 2015,,"The seats are hard and uncomfortable, at 6ft 3"" I struggled to fit in, and I had an aisle seat. Not much else to say, other than the colour scheme inside the planes is nauseating. That bright yellow needs to be got rid of! Priority boarding is a must.",Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3
9,prebook a priority seat,H Martinez,United States,2nd August 2015,,Prebook a priority seat and ask for Row 16 which is the exit row. If no one else pays for and reserves an exit row seat you may be th eonly person sitting in the exit row even if the rest of the aircraft is packed. Exit row seats are not assigned to regular passengers. The leg room is great which compensates from the fact that none of the seats on Ryanair recline which is a good thing in that you never have the seat in front of you pressed against your face or run the risk of a passenger in front pushing back their seat while you are eating a meal or when you have a drink on the drop-down tray and it ends up on your lap. The thing you need to do with Ryanair is to know and follow the rules. ,Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737,3x3
8,seats were comfy and clean,David Nolsoe,Canada,11th July 2015,,Seats were comfy and clean. I'm 5'9 and my son is 6'1 and we had enough room. Seatback in front is recessed where your legs go so it provides more legroom. These seats do not recline.,Ryanair ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
4,Ryanair seats are poor,S James,United Kingdom,24th January 2014,,Ryanair seats are poor in that they do not touch or support your back from your shoulders downwards. they are fixed ie they do not recline which is a good thing so that the person in front does not end up in your lap. Pay the extra and get the emergency aisle rows it is well worth it.,Ryanair ,Economy Class,BOEING 737,3x3
3,seats are not adjustable,F Houiellebecq,United Kingdom,12th January 2014,,Seats are not adjustable apart from one arm the inside one raising up. which means you have to squeeze past the initial arm when sitting down No pocket on the back of the seat in front to store or keep things while visiting the toilet. Advertising in every available place. No sick bag provision. Very little room to move when tray folded down.,Ryanair ,Economy Class,BOEING 737,3x3
9,still a nice experience,A Wong,Canada,19th April 2020,1," I flew business class after Covid-19 measures were implemented, so I came in expecting reduced cabin service, and that was what I got. That being said, even with all the precautionary measures, I was surprised that they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together. Air Canada uses Super Diamond seats, which arrange passengers in a reverse herringbone configuration. It's a pretty standard product, though I must say I really like the colour scheme that Air Canada uses. It just looks really clean and the colours contrast nicely. Due COVID-19, I requested the upgrade to business as a precautionary measure, and I wasn't disappointed. Even with reduced cabin services, it was still a nice experience. Sure, there's no pillow or bar service- they've warned about this on their website, but as it turned out, when they said they would be serving pre-packaged meals, all they meant was that they weren't going to plate your meal for you. It was still business quality (veal from Hawksworth), but they simply didn't give you that picture perfect plating that is so greatly appreciated. Despite the lack of a pillow, the seats were still quite comfortable, though it could still do with more lumbar support, and the lack of a pillow made the sleeping position a tad awkward because my head was dipped backwards even with the power adjustable headrest. Service could admittedly be a bit more polished, though to be fair, part of this definitely has to do with the COVID-19 precautions. I should probably try upgrading again when this blows over. I do appreciate how quiet the cabin was, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the food quality was not compromised as a result of their infection control measures.",Air Canada ,Business Class,Boeing 787-8,1x2x1
8,stretch your legs outward,A Wong,Canada,30th March 2020,1," I picked seat 13A, which is right behind the bulkhead seat. This was a good choice, especially since the bulkhead row does not let you fully stretch your legs outwards, and you also don't get seat storage at all. The seat reclines, and the footrest folds down from the seat in front of you (again, another reason not to take the bulkhead seat). I would note that the Singapore Airlines leg rests for Premium Economy are nicer, since they extend from under your seat. It would be nice if they installed a clip at the end of the tray table, because the second half of it is really flimsy, but on the bright side, these seats were definitely felt newer than the ones they had fitted on their 777-300ERs.",Air Canada ,Premium Economy,Boeing 787-9,2x3x2
4,Lot of space,Jacob Krogh Jørgensen,Denmark,18th September 2019,0," Lot of space, very expensive WiFi, and bad food. I was traveling to Copenhagen, had a bad experience in the airport. But my stay onboard was okay. Food was not good at all, the staff was friendly though.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
1,discomfort was exacerbated,Marcus Williams,United Kingdom,15th September 2019,1," My flight was 10.5 hours in a Boeing 777-300 but the discomfort was exacerbated by the fact that a very large man was sitting in the aisle seat next to me, and a normal sized man in the other adjacent seat. The flight was full - they had to bounce 5 passengers because they had overbooked.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
2,leg room was also very tight,E Varsten,Canada,31st August 2019,1," Although not the worst seats that AC uses, the Embraer 190 leg room was also very tight, with old seats, and non functioning USB charging port. Additionally this plane does not provide any AC charging.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,E190,2x2
2,Seats are too narrow,Keith Richardson,Canada,27th May 2019,1," Seats are too narrow (17) and aisles are too narrow leading to unhappy passengers and crew, maybe tolerable for 5 hr YVR-YYZ but anything else? The 777 cabin width was always a challenge for seating compared to A330 and now A350. Airbus add those extra few inches in width that make all the difference to personal space.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
7,access to the seat was tedious,R Galten,Canada,23rd April 2019,1," Moving around cabin is difficult and using the washroom depicts that one must stand 10 minutes. The customer accommodation for the access to the seat was tedious. This is not my personal experience, however my wife’s. ",Air Canada ,Economy Class,A320-200,3x3
8,seats have easy storage,M Keane,Canada,16th March 2019,1," Air Canada North America Business Class is a product that does not compare to any other airline found in Canada. Their meals are plated with silverware, and are accompanied with bread and butter, a salad, and dessert. All seats have easy storage, a nice video monitor, and large legroom. The service is a bit slow, as it takes a while to get a top up on my drink.",Air Canada ,Business Class,Embraer 190,1x2
1,Seats are awful,Ken Watkins,Canada,11th March 2019,0," 5'9 230#, wife is 5'5 170#. Long haul Toronto to Sydney return. Both flights same aircraft In the row of 4 there are 5 metal obstruction, either seat supports or rails to keep your feet out of the aisle. This configuration means there are only 2 large wells for bag stowage, shared by 4 people. This means if anyone plans to use the underseat stowage, you all lose footspace. There are several 120V charge ports under there as well, with sharp corners, positioned to stab you in the shin if you move your leg. Since every person in the row straddles a seat support, you all share footwells; you get to play footsies with a perfect stranger. I'm sure they love that. But the worst part is the recline position. Reclining the backrest, moves the seat forward and up at the front, to create more of a bucket seat. However, this puts your legs into an impossible position. There is no way to stretch out. Simply picture it. The seat cushion is pointing up, while your legs point down. It doesn't work so well. Fully reclined was unusable for me. Speaking to others at the bathroom, other passengers agreed. Seats are awful.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x4x3
2,Boeing 787-9 is poorly configured,S Baljen,Canada,20th January 2019,1, Boeing 787-9 is poorly configured that passenger comfort is given the least importance. Seat width and seat pitch of 30 inch is too tight for long flight. Seats are too thin and springy. Also long lines at the washrooms. ,Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-9,3x3x3
1,787 seats are too narrow,R Hamuraj,Canada,3rd January 2019,1," The Boeing 787 seats are too narrow. Its small to the point you cant get comfortable for the 9hr flight. Don't get me wrong. Im not expecting the best, but this is stupid. I flew last year and I thought it was in my head. But this time around its really the seats. Im 5'8, 160lb medium/slim build. My arms, elbows are too wide for the seat. In a Aisle seat my shoulder kept being hit. Its hard to rest you neck/head. The designers did a bad job of the ergonomics of the body sitting for 9 hours and how people sleep. The service of the airline is great.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787 ,3x3x3
3,no space for cabin luggage,Abhishek Shrivastava,Canada,13th December 2018,1, The flight was too cramped up with no space for cabin luggage. My cabin bag had to be kept in the business class as they had no space.  I remember pressing the button for air hostess help at least 4 times and every time no body showed and the request button was reset. Overall a bad experience and I would not recommend travelling with Air Canada.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777 300 ER,3x4x3
3,most uncomfortable seats,M Farlen,Canada,24th November 2018,1," We travelled Air Canada from Montreal to LAX yesterday in Business Class. The plane is a new Boeing 737. It seems like Air Canada is following the Rouge tradition by having the most uncomfortable seats imaginable even on a brand new plane. The thickness of the back cushion is very thin and there is a horizontal rod that is placed it seems to cause maximum discomfort. This flight is 6 hours! The foot rests are also extraordinarily cheap and won’t go down unless you get on your knees and manipulate it manually. Also, just like horrible Rouge, the seat posts are positioned so that you cannot store any hand luggage in front of your seat . The middle section has to be shared by seat neighbors. Air Canada used to be our favorite airline and now we have advised our travel agent to research any alternative to Air Canada and Rouge.",Air Canada ,Premium Economy,Boeing 737-800,2x2
2,Avoid the Boeing 787,E Vaneer,Canada,16th November 2018,1, The Boeing 787 has the worst configuration and uncomfortable seats. Aisles and seat width is too tight for the average passenger on long flights. Seat pitch is limited to 31 inch and you can barely stretch your legs. Avoid the Boeing 787 aircraft.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,787,3x3x3
3,seats are very narrow,D Gorden,Canada,27th October 2018,1," The most uncomfortable long haul flight I have been on. I was seated in row 38, an aisle seat on the Boeing 787-9. I am fairly close to average size (barely 6 feet tall and 185 pounds), so not tiny but neither am I a giant by any means. My knees were just about touching the seat in front of me, the seats are very narrow, and thankfully the passenger seated in the middle seat was not large but he did fill the seat and needed all his elbow room. The seats are very short, offering little or no support to the thighs. This adds to the discomfort, particularly on a long flight. I could not stretch both my legs out fully at all while seated. Trying to use some of the aisle is next to impossible due to the extremely narrow aisles. There is barely room for the refreshment carts to pass. I spent a great deal of time on the flight moving my arm and shoulder inwards as the carts and other passengers were passing and bumping into me and there was no space. Seat backs are very thin and offer no support either. Due to all the factors mentioned, I found sleep to be impossible. The passenger at the window seat managed about an hour's sleep but basically had the same complaint, and needed muscle relaxers for her back towards the end of the flight. Anyone getting out of their seats found it necessary to pull on the seat in front of them for balance and leverage. For relief, I got up to stand and stretch at the rear of the plane 3 times on the eastbound flight and 4 times on the westbound leg. Also, on the outbound flight, our connection was a little late so we went straight to board our London flight without buying snacks, etc. Be warned, we found out on board that in economy you cannot buy snacks. You have to content yourself with the dinner and continental breakfast and I think you get a very small bag of pretzels with a drink. Cabin is beautiful. The in-flight entertainment system was excellent, although some people were asking why wi-fi was not available. The selection of movies, TV programs, and interactive games was OK for me. In summary, I will do everything I possibly can to avoid using this aircraft again. If it even means connecting through another city, I will do it. Three days later, I am still feeling the effects.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-9 ,3x3x3
2,seats extremely uncomfortable,J Veenaj,Canada,8th October 2018,1," Boeing 787 seats are extremely uncomfortable. Seat padding is thin and you can feel it on your back. On the other hand seat pitch and width is too tight. Basically this aircraft was designed for 8 abreast but airlines have squeezed 3x3x3 adding an extra seat. Aisles are so narrow that you continuously get bumbled by trolleys/passengers. Avoid this aircraft and try to use Airbus 330/350 if possible, because fuselage is about a foot wider with same number of seats",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
7,choose seat due to extra legroom,Cory Loughran,Australia,10th December 2017,1," This review is based on exit row 31 on the Boeing 787-8. I was in seat 31J from Vancouver to Brisbane, a nearly 15 hour flight. I specifically chose this seat due to the extra legroom it provided. On this particular flight it was $150 extra to select the seat as it is classified as preferred (not to be confused with premium economy). When we boarded the plane there was a small overhead bin above our row that was able to fit all of my and my partners bags (2 backpacks, a suit bag and a shopping bag of snacks) as we were unable to store anything for takeoff. I was expecting brief instructions from one of the flight attendants on how the emergency door worked as we were right beside it however this never happened, I assume because there was a flight attendant jump seat facing us on the other side of the exit. Once the flight took off and the seatbelt sign was off we were able to get a few things from the overhead bin above and had no issues from the flight attendants storing the on the floor, we just made sure there were right against our seat so as to not block the emergency exit. The tray tables were in the armrests which made it difficult to get too if the person beside you was asleep with their arm on the opening. The entertainment screen was a folding arm below the armrest that swung up in front of you. For me it was not high enough and it did not quite sit centred in front of you which was slightly annoying.There were also 2 power supply outlets located on either side of the middle seat, nearly at the ground. I consider myself a tall with an average build (190cm 90kg, 6' 2"" 200lb) but the seats were exceptionally comfortable compared to other economy seats. The recline was average and the moveable headrest was ideal for someone as tall as I am. With the new 787s the seats recline in a way where your seat moves forward slightly when you recline the back. I can see this being an issue when you already have limited legroom, but for this seat it was a nice touch as it seemed to be more comfortable than just the back reclining. The extra legroom was the true winner though. You basically had unlimited legroom as the next row of seats was about 1.5 to 2 meters away. I could stretch my legs out as much as I want and with the unique way the seats recline I believe it was the most comfortable you could be trying to sleep in a seated position. The biggest downside was that in the centre was the washrooms, one on each aisle. Although you could not smell anything for the duration of the flight, the door was quite loud when people let is slam. Also people would line up for the washroom in the area directly in front of you. At one point in the middle of a deep sleep a gentleman tripped over my legs as he was waiting in line and fell right on top of me! Other than that the flight went smoothly, I just put some earplugs in and that drowned out most of the people, children and washroom door slamming. I managed to get about 10 hours of sleep in 2 different periods, which made the 15 hour flight fly by.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
9,seats do offer good recline,A Wong,Canada,6th December 2017,1," Flight attendants aren't overly friendly, but they are helpful and attentive, walking up and down the aisles quite often. Aside from the in-flight meal, the cabin crew does come around with drinks and more complimentary snacks quite often. Because Air Canada use a 3x4x3 layout for their 777, seats may feel a bit cramped. This is particularly noticeable when you're trying to have your in-flight meals and you're bumping elbows with your neighbour (the food is good though, even for economy class standards). I consider myself to be average build for someone who is 5'8, and those seats were still reasonably comfortable. I would say however that for the seats on the middle-column, under-seat stowage is odd, since you only get 3 holes for 4 people to put their bags under, which means your neighbour's carry-on may encroach on your legroom. These seats do offer good recline, as the back reclines as the seat cushion slides forward. With the amount of leg room you get, this typically doesn't reduce your legroom dramatically enough to be uncomfortable. Seats are also quite plushy yet offer adequate back support, and the they offer an adjustable leather headrest. You will also find that throughout the flight, the new 777-300ERs feature the Boeing 787 mood-lighting which gradually changes colour throughout the flight. It looks cool and I did rest well on the flight, but there is a relationship between mood lighting and the quality of my rest has yet to be determined.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
4,Seats extremely uncomfortable,M Green,Canada,23rd October 2017,, A330 seats are extremely uncomfortable. Airlines need to have a 'use-by' date on seat bottoms as older aircraft have seat bottoms which show a high degree of wear. It would seem a low cost to at least build in better cushioning in seats where the flights are 10 hours or more. Feels like some form of torture to make passengers sit in seats like this.  A/V system is also very dated and laggy. Reinvest some of your profits in improved seats and a/V systems. Aisles ridiculously narrow.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
2,seats extraordinarily uncomfortable,C Kearan,United States,14th October 2017,," I am 5'4"" and normal weight. We were in row 30. We found the seats to be extraordinarily uncomfortable; little in the way of cushioning and no lumbar support. The seat pitch was terrible, they are too close together. I was unable to see or reach my belongings with my tray table down. This is particularly bad in the window seat. If you are on the aisle you can pull your belongings out to the side to reach them. If the seat in front of you is reclined it is in your face unless you recline yours too--creating a domino effect behind the first reclinee. We do not like the nickel and dime attitude of charging for seat selection ahead of time. On this flight from Portland OR to Toronto the charge is $45-46 for 'premium economy' (it did not look like seat pitch was noticeably better in these seats in front of the wing), and $21 for regular economy behind the wing. If you don't pay to choose a seat ahead of time, AC assigns you seats 24-hours ahead of flight time. Our seats were assigned by AC. We did get to sit together, but in row 30 out of 33. There is one toilet in economy class on this plane. The inside of the plane looked old and in need of minor repairs to seats and surrounds. Food and drink service was provided once at the beginning of the flight and once toward the end of the flight. Flight attendants were no-where to be seen between those times. (Probably serving in first class). USB ports at each seat, no AC outlet. Small screen on the back of the seat in front of you. A little high for me to comfortably view. But good movie selection. Under-seat storage was good, with no center divider to get in the way. Overhead bins were small, with just enough depth to accommodate a regulation size carry on placed sideways. Although we did get there and back without mishap, it felt like what I imagine it would be like to fly on Spirit Air. We will go out of our way to find an alternative carrier for our next trip to Toronto.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Embraer E190,2x2
1,horrible for big persons,Pierre Cazes,France,10th September 2017,," Boeing 767 is horrible for big persons. Absolutely no place for legs while 9 hours of flight and very unconfortable seats. No tv on seat, food of low quality and insufficient quantity.  When linking to the internal flight at Montreal for Ottawa, the plane was 3 hours late with no explanation.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 767,2x3x2
2,seats are so tight,J Jahaven,Canada,10th September 2017,," New Boeing 787, seats are so tight with narrow pitch of 31 inch that it is terrible for long haul flights. Aisle are so tight that trolley barely passes. ",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
2,extremely uncomfortable ,S Jain,United Kingdom,24th June 2017,," Flew premium economy Toronto to Sao Paolo. Seats extremely uncomfortable on long flights. The seat cushion tilts downward toward the front edge of the seat, so there is no thigh support and all your body weight lands on your tailbone, which becomes painful over a 9.5 hour flight. When the seat is reclined, you gradually slide forward off the seat and have to keep hoisting yourself back up. The headrest has no wings like in economy class, so your head can flop from side to side when you sleep unless you remembered to bring a neck cushion. Mine would not stay in the raised position, providing another source of constant frustration. Did not eat the dinner, but breakfast was a small plain omlet - I think the same as in regular economy. This flight was full and the crew were kept busy looking after the entire economy class section. There were sometimes queues for the single lavatory at the front of the premium economy section.",Air Canada ,Premium Economy,Boeing 787,2x3x2
2,seats are incredibly narrow,H Ye,Canada,4th June 2017,," The Boeing 777-300 economy seats are incredibly narrow that many people have shoulders touching their neighbors' shoulders all the time. It's even uncomfortable to turn your body during the flight worrying to wake the person up. Legroom is also not very good for a 186cm tall. Had to keep my legs open, especially when the person in front of me recline the seat. Entertainment system is good, but no good movies or documentaries for me to watch. ",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
2,Seats are very narrow,S Taschber,Canada,1st May 2017,," Flown the Boeing 787 today between Brussels and Montreal, seats 34A and 34B. Seats are very narrow, actually narrower than an average body. There is unavoidable and constant body contact with your neighbour. Happy mine was a nice chap. Armrest is too long and the control for the video system is situated on top of the armrest, meaning my neighbor accidentally either switched off my movie, or changed the volume, or switched on/off my individual light about a dozen time in a 7 hour flight. It was my first experience on Boeing 787 and I will try in the future to look for alternative planes or airlines whenever possible. I am glad this experience was on dayflight and not on a red eye. I do not think possible to sleep on such seats.  Large widow and a good screen however appreciated (food very mediocre like on all northern american airlines but this is another subject).",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
3,hardly any leg room,Khalid Saeed,United States,26th April 2017,,"❎ Unverified |  I flew from Toronto to Dubai on the Boeing 787-9, it was about 13 hours flight. The seats on this aircraft are so uncomfortable that you cannot even sit comfortably and there is hardly any leg room.  I was so disappointed flying with Air Canada. In fact their smaller planes like E75 has more leg room than the Boeing 787. Shame on Boeing and Air Canada.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-9,3x3x3
2,worst seating experience,Steve Bennett,United States,15th February 2017,,"❎ Unverified |  This was my worst seating experience ever. The new high density Boeing 777 is an absolute nightmare flying with Air Canada in economy. Thankfully I had an aisle seat on this packed HKG~YVR flight but that was the only thing good about this trip. Seats ridiculously narrow. Aisle very narrow. Monitor controls in the the armrests unbelievably stupid concept. Constant lines for lavatories the entire flight. My seat reclined an acceptable amount - but felt too guilty for the poor soul behind me, so I didn't recline. ",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300er,3x4x3
7,I could stretch out a bit,S Rainer,Australia,11th February 2017,," I chose seat 18K based on the reviews on this seat as it provided extra leg room. I was not disappointed in this regard. I am not particularly tall (5'7"") however, the leg room meant I could stretch out a bit which was great, especially nice on the evening flight. The seat on the way over reclined well but for some reason on the way back it took too more effort to recline and seemed to come forward to the upright position of its own accord, which was annoying. In addition, it didn't recline enough for a good night's sleep. That's economy I guess. This seat was located right behind premium economy, and well away from the toilets so it was peaceful. Be aware that, in economy, the seats are particularly narrow. I'm quite a slender build and the seat was only just wide enough for me. Also, there is only a single point for a headphone charger so you can't charge up a phone or ipad. Also, no wifi. Be aware that, due to the extra space, babies can be placed in these rows. It was worth paying the extra $250 (return) for the extra space.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200LR,3x4x3
2,Boeing 787 seat in economy is horrible,Leo MacDonald,Canada,5th February 2017,," I love Air Canada and have made them my default airline for all my business travel. I'm lucky enough to fly business class on some of my flights especially overseas but usually fly economy on domestic flights. I was excited to fly on the Boeing 787 yesterday from Vancouver to Toronto as I heard so many great things about this aircraft and I have to say, I do think it's a remarkably well-designed plane. However, the Air Canada seating in economy class is horrible. It is so cramped that my body was aching by the time I arrived in Toronto. When I first sat down my passport dropped on the floor which I attempted to pick up but it was impossible to actually bend down. And I'm only 5.6 and of average weight. I was only able to retrieve it by having the other two passengers in my row get out of their seats. The overhead bins were full but yet there was little room under the seat for storage. My bag sat on my feet for the whole trip. Two of the passengers in the row ahead of us decided to drop back their seats right at takeoff making everything oh so lovely. I've never experienced tighter seating than what I experienced on this aircraft. I'll fly Air Canada still but not on this plane, much prefer the 767's. One thing I noticed was how many other passengers were complaining about the seating. That is something I've never encountered before. Truly one of my worst flying experiences ever.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
5,feel more cramped on your seat,H Michel,Singapore,22nd January 2017,," Seat 30G on the Boeing 777-300ER is a mix feeling seat. First, you have plenty of leg room and lucky to not be sardines like squeezed in the other rows. Being at the first row the screen and table are located in armrests of both side hence you feel more cramped on your seat in that row. Toilets are just front of you hence there is almost always people queuing on your right waiting for their turn especially when flying trans Pacific long hauls. To squeeze more people into the plane Air Canada has removed 1 toilet that was accros the only one remaining on the right side so when seating on 30G there is only 1 toilet from all pax seated from premium eco till the last cabin. The left side still has 2 toilets therefore people from the right will cross from the right to left side of the plane via the leg room space of row 30. So you are always woke up, pump into when people are crossing from one side to the other and back. Air Canada will to make more money is heavily compromising passenger comfort. Very disappointing and time has come for their ranking to be reviewed so that people arent fooled when making their travel plans.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
2,avoid this aircraft,Jack Franchino,United States,9th October 2016,,"I flew in seat 1A for my flight from Detroit to Toronto Pearson, the CRJ is a regional aircraft, therfore the legroom was bad and the condition and amenities of the seats were poor. The seats are synthetic leather which is a plus in comparison to some of the older fabric seats found in United's aircrafts. Avoid this aircraft - the new Q400s are much cleaner and spacious.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,CRJ-200,2x2
10,recommend Premium Economy,Jack Franchino,United States,9th October 2016,,"The newly refurbished Boeing 777-300ER aircraft are great and have the exact same seats as their new 787s which is a great plus. I highly recommend upgrading to Premium Economy, as the seat is extremely roomy, despite it being only 3 or something more inches wide, it makes a huge difference. The legroom is great, though the footrest takes up some of it. The entertainment system is great, the amenities such as 110V power and additional storage space is great.",Air Canada ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300ER,2x4x2
8,paid for the first row of economy,G Hamell,Canada,31st August 2016,, Paid extra for the first row of economy on Boeing 767-300ER. Well worth it. Tons of leg room. Screen is on the bulkhead and awkward. Very smooth. Seats themselves are average economy seats. Overall this is a very good wide body arrangement. Only 7 across in economy. Compared to the 10 across horror on some of Air Canada's other planes this was very comfortable.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 767-300ER,2x3x2
5,it is a dense configuration,M Howard,United Kingdom,2nd August 2016,,"The Boeing 777-300ERseats are a little cramped (3x4x3 layout). It is a dense configuration so you do feel crowded. The seats aren't particularly wide. The IFE is buggy, and kept crashing and restarting during and after announcements, though the selection of movies is pretty good. There is a tiny box that limits your under-seat stowage, so backpacks can be hard to fit under. There is minimal space for storage for all passengers in each ABC or DEFG etc. seat group at the same time. The seat is a typical international seat. It's not special in any ways, but it is a better seat than some other carriers.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
8,comfortable with a huge leg room,Y Zheng,Canada,29th July 2016,,"Flying from Ottawa to Toronto. It was a very short flight, but the experience is great. It was an Airbus 321.

1,my shoulders were killing me,Michael Kelley,United States,17th July 2016,,"What a downgrade! I have been loyally flying Air Canada for years between the west coast of the US and China. I loved their 767 flight between Vancouver and Shanghai. Roomy and small. Then they changed to the 787 with a 3x3x3 layout and 17 inch width. I am not a tall or wide person, but at the end of this 12 hour flight I had a back ache and my shoulders were killing me. Other than the narrow width, there were two other problems with the seats on this plane. The seat backs have no stiff material between your back and the contents of the seat pocket behind you. You can literally feel the edges of the in-flight magazine or whatever the person behind you is reaching for as they remove or insert it into their seat back pocket. The entertainment control pad is exactly where lots of people's elbow contacts the thin armrest. Sleeping was a problem because my elbow kept turning on the overhead light and hitting the attendant button. It was kind of like a disco inside the plane as other passengers did the same, especially when the cabin lights were dimmed. I see that Air Canada has tapped their new high-density 777 3x4x3 to carry passengers between Shanghai and Vancouver this summer (2016). I will for sure be avoiding that one!",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
3,the worst seats ever,Kathryn Saunders,Canada,12th May 2016,,"We paid for extra legroom seats on two other long haul flights (Vancouver to Sydney and Barcelona to Montreal) and it was money well spent. Cannot say the say for the recent flight AC 08 Hong Kong to Vancouver. The bulkhead seats 31J and 31H were the worst seats ever. Yes, there was lots of legroom but the flight attendants use the space for parking their service carts and the bathroom is to the immdiate left and in constant use. People using the bathroom naturally congregated in the extra bulkhead space which meant stretching your legs into the extra space was impossible. Lots of loud chatter, doors opening, lights, people bumping into your feet and entertainment system and I felt Air Canada should be paying us to seat there. Also there is no place to put your book and other travel stuff so it has to be in the overhead. I will pay for extra legroom again but will never book the seats on either side of the middle row. Those seats would offer the extra legrrom, some privacy, and a pocket for personal travel items. On the plus side the entertainment system was excellent.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3
8,very comfortable seat,B Siska,Canada,25th April 2016,,"A very comfortable seat on the A321. interesting how the seats are blue, even though red is the Canadian color.

I'm a petite 5' and 53 kilos but found the seating cramped, and my neck was pushed forward by a bulging immovable neck rest. Why can't there be softer neck supports with adjustable heights and wings? Hard to snatch any rest on a midnight flight when you can't even sit comfortably. Toilets were not very clean. On a brighter note, the cabin crew were diligent, helpful and hardworking, but the food was average. The breakfast pancakes in a custard with strawberry fraise was a standout and delicious.

The new 3x4x3 arrangement is ridiculous. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable. You sit shoulder-to-shoulder with the passenger next to you. And if you move your elbow even the slightest, you trigger the media remote located on the top of the armrest. I will avoid AC like the plague from now on.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x4x3

I am not a tall person so this is usually OK. We this year it seems the seat layout has been adjusted. There is much less room.  Counter staff and flight attendants don't change seat spacing, this is done by uncaring corporate types. Oh and not that it is important but 2 out of 3 entertainment systems were acting up.

Airlines who offer this product for long distance flights should be avoided as they clearly no proud in their product!",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x4x3
6,32 is enough for me,Zachary Spooner,United Kingdom,29th October 2015,,"What I like about this aircraft is the legroom, 32"" is enough for me. Although, the problem is the fuselage narrowing at the back is a problem. people are having that cramped feel and also having to be slightly out of alignment with the tray table and the TV screen. I am also not happy with their new Boeing 777-300's because they are cramming in more seats that only give you a 31"" seat pitch and a 3-4-3 configuration.

9,very pleased with Air Canada,Krisztina Mekli,United Kingdom,25th October 2015,,"This was a flight between Toronto Pearson and Hamburg. Despite some reviews about Air Canada, this flight was absolutely fine. We took off in time and arrived a little bit before schedule. The seat was very comfortable with enough legroom (although I am not particularly tall). The aircraft looked like new and was very clean.The FAs were kind and looked after us very well. The selection for in-flight entertainment was great. I did not try the seat recline so I cannot comment on that (hence the 3*). Maybe what Air Canada could improve on is the food. It was like an average airline food, OK but nothing fancy. However, I found the portion a little bit too small. All in all I was very pleased with Air Canada and will use them again.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
10,Air Canada customer review,John Steeves,Canada,17th October 2015,,"Business Class seat from Vancouver to Seoul on new Air Canada Boeing 787. Fantastic seat with plenty of comfort and storage. Food was very good and flight attendants were very attentive. The lie-flat seats on the Boeing 787 are incredibly flexible - unlike the awful business class seat on Air Canada's three class Boeing 777(W) where both business and economy seats are awful; the latter for being so narrow; the former because you stick your feet into a well that does not allow you subsequently move your feet (Can you say coffin!). But back to the Air Canada Boeing 787-8; you will thank yourself for being very smart if you can book this aircraft on your next long-haul route. The IFE is very good, although all airlines seem to be packing off the number of movies available. Thus, I usually see all the month's offering in my first couple of flights each month. My sleep was uninterrupted as they provide a good size pillow and a nice comforter. ",Air Canada ,Premium Economy,Boeing 787-8,1x2x1
2,Boeing 787 a disappointment,Marie Johnson,United States,10th October 2015,,"I was really looking forward to flying on this Air Canada Boeing 787. It was a disappointment. I was supposed to be in Business class on the trip to Copenhagen and I was downgraded to Premium Economy. While the services offered in Premium Economy is more than I usually receive on Delta, the seats was uncomfortable. I fly Delta Economy Plus a great deal so I will be comparing AC seats against what I am used to sitting in. While the seats on the 787 are wider, you don't have as much leg room. On a transcontinental flight I found myself getting leg cramps and a sore butt. I don't even get that in Economy! The food was okay. It was actually better than the business class main meal I chose on the return trip home. The seat recline was inadequate and to get the seat back to the upright position, you have to grab hold of the back of it and pull up. I thought I had a defective seat until I saw others doing it. The entertainment center is pretty good. My headset plug was kind of loose, but there was a little retractable knob that you can wrap the cord around to ease the tension. The seat storage was inadequate as well. There was hardly room for any of my things. The service was okay. Not as attentive as I used to receiving. I loved the big windows, I had an aisle seat and I was able to outside. On the return trip, I was in Business Class and that seat was awesome. it was a true lay flat seat. The entertainment center was easy to use and the remote was helpful.",Air Canada ,Premium Economy,Boeing 787-8,2x3x2
2,nothing good to say,Siva Krish,Canada,29th May 2015,,Booked Air Canada flight to Orlando from Toronto - Return. To my surprise they put us in a low cost Air Canada Rouge flight. Seat pitch was too tight seat do not recline no Inflight TV. Nothing good to say. I will avoid Rouge flights.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,BOEING 767,2x4x2
1,very limited leg room,T Mayes,Canada,29th March 2015,,We paid for Preferred seats row 12 window and middle on the flight from Newark to Vancouver. The seat diagram online showed a bulkhead wall in front of the seats but in reality there was no wall and the business seats had a tiny curtain from the top of the seats. We knew the arm rests wouldn't go up but we assumed there would be a wall of some type. So when the business seats reclined we had very limited leg room. The middle seat had no pocket because the view was straight down the whole business class section between the seats. We would have been better off in a regular seat which at least has arm rests that go up. I complained to Air Canada and all they offered was a 15% coupon for a future flight but with major restrictions. The reply from customer relations even stated that a discounted fare would be cheaper than applying the coupon to the full fare. This is the second time we received coupons we could not use as compensation. We will avoid Air Canada in the future.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A319,3x3
1,seats are crammed in so tight,Nick Smith,United Kingdom,22nd March 2015,,Just done five flights with them in the last three weeks. The seats are crammed in so tight. I'm not a big guy but I struggled with the lack of room. Four out of the five flights the entertainment didn't work. There was no food included on any of the flights including a seven hour flight. Will never fly with them again.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
7,seat was fine,O Barraclough,Australia,30th January 2015,,The movie selections were not great but the seat was fine I'm quite tall and i had an etiquette amount of leg room. This was a 14 hour flight from Sydney to Vancouver.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300 (2 class),3x3x3
4,difficult to manoeuvre,W Atkinson,Canada,19th November 2014,,"Although we were flying Premium Economy to London (LHR) via Montreal (YUL) there were no PE seats on this CRJ. The only concession to this from AC was giving us ""preferred seats"" 12A and 12C. It is difficult to manoeuvre in and out of these seats. Typically this is a small jet and everything about it just reads ""cramped."" There is no IFE. We were supposed to get complimentary snacks but the attendants overlooked this entirely.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,CRJ,2x2
8,overhead storage is plentiful,W Atkinson,Canada,19th November 2014,,My spouse and I were flying to/from LHR via YUL; our outbound trip was at the end of July and home trip in early September. These seats are located immediately behind a service bulkhead and afford a lot of legroom. The IFES and table tray are located in the armrests as is the remote control for the IFES and overhead lights etc. We found the trays easy to deploy but it took both arms and a lot of effort to get the IFES unit out of the armrest. When deployed it was difficult to view as it was somewhat offset by the armrest or the tray (if deployed). The remote control is on wired tether which often tangled with other items and accidentally turned lights on or off or called cabin crew unnecessarily - annoying. The seats are leather-faced and comfortable. An amenities kit is provided with pillow and blanket. The seats are close to washrooms. When cabin crew were accessing the bulkhead storage there was a tendency to hit my feet with the door. Also this is a service area for c rew so it can be noisy as can be the sounds of passengers walking to and from the washrooms. Overhead storage is plentiful. Meals were excellent as was the crew service. For overseas flights it is worthwhile paying extra for the comfort. If we had to do this again we would probably choose seats farther back in this 24-seat cabin to avoid the bulkhead closet crew activity and washroom sounds.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,2x4x2
5,not particularly comfortable,W Atkinson,Canada,19th November 2014,,"YUL-YYZ. Although we were flying Premium Economy from YWG-YUL-LHR and return there were no PE seats on this aircraft. As a concession AC assigns PE passengers to ""preferred seats"" so in our case this was 12D and 12E which is immediately behind Business Class on this 120-seat aircraft. Boarding this flight was a zoo with many passengers dragging huge carry on luggage and scrambling to find space. As we were in a bulkhead row there is no under seat storage so we also had to scramble to stow our carry ons (just a few small bags by the way). Curiously as the IFES is tied to the seats in front of you that meant there were only two screens for three Economy passengers. The seats have 35"" pitch as opposed to 31-33"" in non -preferred seats. Still not particularly comfortable but it is what it is.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A319,3x3
5,It was just tolerable,W Atkinson,Canada,19th November 2014,,"My spouse and I were flying Premium Economy (PE) YWG-YUL-LHR-YUL-YYZ-YWG late August (Outbound) and early September (inbound). Air Canada as a concession to passengers flying in aircraft without PE seating assigned us to ""preferred seats"" which in this case was 12A and 12C which were immediately behind the business class section of the cabin. Boarding was reasonably efficient but hampered by the rush of passengers scrambling to find storage for their massive carry ons. As we had no under seat storage we also had to scramble to ensure our few small carry ons were stowed. Our IFES and almost everyone else's on the port side of the aircraft did not work; AC did give us vouchers which when filed on line gave us a 5% discount on future bookings until spring 2015. Legroom was comfortable and our seats had 3"" more pitch than other Economy class seats; but this is a small aircraft (better than a CRJ) and things still felt cramped. It was just tolerable for the 2.5 hour flight to YWG.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,EMBRAER 90,2x2
9,seats were pretty good,A Entereso,Canada,30th July 2014,,For an 8 hour flight to Paris from Montreal the seats were pretty good. I also liked Air Canada's new 3 cabin interior on this flight. The seat recline was pretty good and I was able to sleep for awhile. enRoute systems were amazing much better than the older system.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
1,very poor seat design,Marcus Gallie,Canada,30th July 2014,,Air Canada have gone with a very poor seat design both from the perspective of comfort and functionality. The width of the seats has been reduced and there is no usable armrest space. Plus in their wisdom controls for the PTV screen have been placed on top of the armrests (so you are inadvertently putting the overhead light on calling the flight attendant or changing channel). In addition the headphone jack for the PTV is next to the screen so the cabin staff are catching cables when serving trays (in the limited space) etc.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
2,seat configuration is horrible,J Hornibrook,Canada,30th July 2014,,"I sat in seat 23E from YVR-YYZ and this seat configuration is horrible. This is a middle seat and you are constantly pressing against your neighbours on both sides. There is also a support strut directly in front of you so your feet are in a ""shared"" space. This is a big step backward for Air Canada on a long-haul flight and I will take every possible precaution to avoid this configuration in future travel.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3
9,pitch is beyond generous,Tyler Thomson,Canada,3rd January 2014,,The XM interior that Air Canada introduced a few years ago remains one of my favorite. It provides everything you would expect out of a North American Economy class seat. The pitch is beyond generous and I am able to easily stretch out and the width is acceptable. The entertainment system is also excellent offering a wide variety of entertainment options. Beyond ordinary economy class.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A320,3X3
1,impossible to not touch the neighbors,E Provost,Canada,3rd January 2014,,"Air Canada reconfigured some B777-300 to squeeze more seats. Economy class was changed from 3x3x3 configuration to 3x4x3. Seats shrank from 18.5"" wide to 17"". It's impossible to not touch the neighbors. Also less space for legs and I suspect the seats recline less.",Air Canada ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x4x3
3,avoid flying them if possible,M Park,United States,3rd January 2014,,Flew in 18B 11-28-13 YYC-YVR which was bad enough but AC used to fly the E190 PDX-YYZ and back which is dreadful for a flight that long in a narrow body. AC has no respect for their Star Alliance FF so I avoid flying them if possible because there's no Economy Plus seating with them. They even tried to charge me for luggage this trip. The CRJ is more comfortable than the E190 in my opinion.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,EMBRAER 190,2X2
6,food was so-so,J Wallwork,Canada,20th April 2013,,Food was so-so. Water offering was quite skimpy. Toilets very small. Seats got very hard by the end of the flight. Viewing screen was very difficult to see.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3
8,seat recline satisfactory,J Wong,New Zealand,19th September 2011,,Good legroom no in flight entertainment component box under the seat in front as with some airlines). Seat recline satisfactory and adjustable headrest of good quality and adjustment.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,B777-200LR,3x3x3

4,hardly recline at all,T Lam,Canada,15th December 2009,,Not sure how anyone can state that Air Canada seats with good recline. It hardly recline at all and when the seat in front of you recline you have to recline if you want to watch the video better otherwise it is really difficult.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,B777-200LR,3x3x3
7,seat recline isn't too bad,Myles Harris,Australia,10th November 2009,,Seats 26G and 28H on my earlier flights. While tight and getting uncomfortable towards the end of the 14hr flight they weren't bad. Seat recline isn't too bad if you are doing it yourself but for someone behind you it can get close to claustrophobic. I have since had seats 18B and 18G with nothing in front of me but a wall to Executive first. The seats are narrower and don't have moveable arm rest thanks to the try being in them. Check in online early to get the best seats you can is my advice.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,B777-200LR,3x3x3
1,worst possible seat you can get,Juergen Weich,Germany,6th October 2009,,YYZ-STL-YYZ - Seat 13A is the worst possible seat you can get.

Seat quite comfortable and enough legroom personal entertainment system with ok selection food average service not very personal but efficient. Be aware A330 seat pitch in economy is varying from 31' to 33' in some planes depending on where you sit - and you also might have to live with an entertainment box limiting your legroom.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,B777/A330,3x4x3
6,seemed more comfortable,Rory McEvoy,Canada,6th November 2008,,YYZ-NRT-YVR-YYZ on B777-300 series. Despite the fact that aircraft type were the same the long 13 hour flight YYZ-NRT in seats 52A&B actually seemed more comfortable. The return flights in seats 33A&B seemed less so. This despite the fact that the B777-300 from YVR-YYZ had a better equipped cabin (winged headrests reliable VOD).,Air Canada ,Economy Class,B777-300,3x3x3
7,seats are pretty decent,J Trevers,United States,1st January 2008,,Seat 20D from JFK to Vancouver 26D on the way back. Seats are pretty decent and IFE is great. It is a small plane for 6 hour flight and with only two bathrooms for economy there were always long lines.,Air Canada ,Economy Class,A319,3x3
3,hard to have a good sleep on,Manan Agarwal,India,19th January 2021,1," The seats were firm and were hard to have a good sleep on (I was able to too because of the 2 AM departure time). While the seats are said to be lie-flat, I don't think they were and it was hard to sleep in the complete ""lie-flat"" position. A blanket was provided but I had to ask for a pillow on the flight. The sets of 3 on the last 2 rows are reserved for cabin crew to use as rest-areas which reduces the amount of noise around your seats if seated there and also increases privacy. The seat was the longest or widest making it hard to stretch out or sleep in a fetal position. You will have to step over your neighbour if they happen to be in a lie-flat position which can be painful at times. A snack bag was provided as were 2 hot meals, all of which tasted pretty good. The IFE screen lagged a lot and there were barely any options to watch on the IFE screen (I recommend carrying your own entertainment devices) and the headphones were terrible (Recommend carrying your own) Wouldn't recommend this flight unless there ae no other suitable options.",Air India ,Business Class,Boeing 777-300 ER,2x3x2
7,seat was comfortable and wide enough,Manan Agarwal,India,19th January 2021,1," A fairly typical layout for business class on a Boeing 787. The seats are made of fabric and are comfortable. You can adjust the firmness of the seat and there is a massage feature (fairly basic though). One sandwich was provided on the 1.5-hour flight from Hyderabad to Delhi which is reasonable considering the duration of the flight and the fact this trip was during the COVID pandemic. The seat was comfortable and wide enough for me to expect a good sleep, a minor inconvenience would be having to step over your neighbour if you happen to have one. All in all, a nice flight",Air India ,Business Class,Boeing 787-8,2x2x2
6,eat width a little restricted,Nikhil Goyal,Poland,18th May 2019,0," Seats generally clean and in good form. Leg room and seat width a little restricted. I'm an average sized guy but surely some people I know who are a little ""larger"" would definitely have a taxing experience.",Air India ,Economy Class,A320,3-3
10,leg space was very good,Sandi Kunda,United States,20th October 2017,," The Boeing 787-8 seats were very comfortable.  Nice interior, the leg space was very good, large overhead bin. IFE had good movies and tv shows. The screen was big, picture quality was good, too. Overall, very good aircraft with comfortable seating, entertainment and storage. ",Air India ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
10,legroom was good,Ashish Menon,United Arab Emirates,16th October 2017,," Boeing 787-8, super seats, great lighting, good in-flight entertainment system, width of the seats were really good, the legroom was good, really good cushioned seats with pillow. Loved the experience, I sat on the aisle seat the accessibility of the seats are good also the storage space above. ",Air India ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
9,leg room in economy the best,Vyshak Vitobha,India,25th September 2016,," I travelled from Mumbai to HKG, which has stopover and change of flight in Delhi. The Mumbai to Delhi aircraft was narrow body A319, which was delayed by 2 hrs due to late availability of the captain and we were made to rush in Delhi to catch the connecting flight. The Boeing 787 was a pleasant surprise. Especially the leg room in economy was the best I have come across till date. The LCD panels for IFE was beautifully designed in order not to impede the viewing, if the person in front reclines. ",Air India ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
7,more space and less crowd,Mohammed Amin,India,5th December 2015,,Air India is one the airlines which use the 3x3x3 configuration on their B777's which is great and results in more space and less crowd. Seats have decent Legroom. The only problem in B777's seats are they are sometimes dirty. IFE mostly don't work and the content is not good anyway.,Air India ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200LR,3x3x3
2,seats were dirty and torn,Tony Ralph,Australia,22nd March 2015,,The seats were dirty and torn there was no inflight entertainment the food served was a disgrace and not eaten by anyone near me. The pockets for magazines etc facing me were all torn away and hanging by a thread. The plane was an hour and half late never any apology or explanation - just accept this is the way it is. Finally the crew were surly disinterested and impolite.,Air India ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A319,3x3
2,seat width however was horrible,A Sharma,Germany,25th April 2013,,It was a bulkhead seat (17H on 777-300ER) right behind the business class cabin. Seat recline is ok and legroom is good. The seat width however was horrible. First reduced due to the tray table in armrest on top of that the remote for entertainment console is also placed in armrest and the holder pokes about an inch into the seat. Uncomfortable to get in or out of the seat and nearly impossible to reposition yourself without getting out if you are slightly on the heavier side. Better for people who feel comfortable in 16 inch seat width. The entertainment screen is folded on a swiveling arm which folds behind your feet. It was quite hard to move it into position (joints were hard) and amazingly the joint which is supposed to holed the screen upright was super smooth! At initial deployment of the screen I had just started watching something with my legs crossed over each other and the screen fell (swiveled on a horizontal axis at the bottom side of the screen) and hit my shin quite hard. For the rest of the flight I was rubbing my shin (and keeping the blanket folded many times on my leg to prevent any further injury due to the screen). I forgot to mention that the controls in the remote which was poking my thigh did not function. Not just on my seat at least 6 more seats around me had the same issue. Thankfully the touchscreen menu on the personal screen was working which enabled me to watch a movie (not much more as the system response was very sluggish and music browse menu quite user unfriendly to use satisfactorily).,Air India ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x3x3
4,personal monitors were out of service,Pulok Gupta,United States,5th April 2011,,"The personal monitors were out of service on both my wife's and mine on the way out. On the way back the monitor's front screen was cracked and mine was not working. We were seated on the ""exit"" row and could not see the front main screen as it very fuzzy and working intermittently.",Air India ,Economy Class,Boeing 777ER,3x4x3
7,seats were comfortable,N Gandhi,United States,13th January 2009,,"Relatively new 777-200LR. The seats were comfortable for most of the flight but towards the end of the 15 hour flight they got a little stiff. The recline was ok. Another 1-2 inches of recline would've been great. I'm 6'2"" tall and found the legroom to be adequate. Not great but adequate. The aisle seat would be the best bet for tall people. The middle and window seats had some footspace taken away because there was a box mounted beneath the seat in front of the passenger.",Air India ,Economy Class,B777-200ER,3x3x3
4,the legspace is quite bad,David Hauptmann,Netherlands,11th August 2017,," Generally everything is OK, considering Transavia is a low budget airline. Only the legspace is quite bad for tall people, the seats are a bit old-fashioned, so other low cost airlines offer better seats (e. g. Eurowings, EasyJet or Ryanair). So if you're tall, avoid long flight without upgrades to a better seat.",Transavia ,Economy Class,Boeing 737-800,3x3
7,I had plenty of legroom,A Wong,Canada,25th November 2019,1," 
EasyJet seats are what you’d expect on a budget airline. No recline, narrow, non-adjustable headrests.

7,seats were a little tired,T Hawes,United Kingdom,8th October 2018,1," The A319 seats were a little tired (old interior) but comfortable none the less.

8,good but not extremely good,J Smethurst,United Kingdom,27th November 2016,,"The easyJet A320 seats aren't much different to a car. Pretty good but not extremely good.

The seats have some storage but not much and the seat width is good.",easyJet ,Economy Class,A320,3x3
1,the seat was pure torture,Mark Squire,United Kingdom,13th November 2016,,"Have been using Easyjet since they were GO and always found reliable. However yesterday flying back from Malaga on a new plane will be the last time. I suffer with a degenerated neck leading to a propensity to trapped nerves the seat was pure torture. The new seats to save space have your head leaning forward from the seat this is ergonomically incorrect. This airline has gone too far the legroom non-existent and the seats painful. I along with another guy stood at the back of the plane for the duration it really was the only option. Last time with Easyjet will now favour Norweign and can't believe I'm saying it, Ryanair. easyJet they seemed to have aggresively raised there food drink prices too",easyJet ,Economy Class,A320,3x3
9,seats are a joy to sit in,A Mackenzie,Denmark,26th August 2016,,"Top marks to easyJet with their non-recline recaro seats. These seats are a joy to sit in, with plenty of leg-room when you sit up straight. Not having some person reclining into your space makes for a very relaxed trip. There is also plenty of under seat storage.",easyJet ,Economy Class,A319,3x3
5,It was hard to get comfortable,S Lanner,Netherlands,22nd August 2016,," Standard short-haul seating with thin cushions and no extra facilities whatsoever. I was on a 40 minute flight time flight from Amsterdam to London, and I wouldn't want to sit in this seat for very much longer than that period of time. It was hard to get comfortable and to prevent yourself from getting pins and needles.",easyJet ,Economy Class,A319,3x3
9,worth the extra fee involved,Peter Driscoll,United Kingdom,6th August 2016,,"Paid extra £18.00 each way for an exit row seat with the extra legroom on this A320. Outward trip in 13A was comfortable enough with plenty of room to stretch my legs. Return leg in a slightly newer A320 in 13F. This plane had slightly harder seats but there seemed to be a more generous seat pitch.

2,seats are so uncomfortable,Dan Ross,United Kingdom,22nd September 2015,,"I've flown easyJet for shorter flights but this was over 4 hours long. Their seats are so uncomfortable as they have no lumbar or neck support. They don't recline. They are a pain, literally! Fine for a short flight, but for longer than a couple of hours, find a premium airline and not a no frills one.",easyJet ,Economy Class,A320,3x3
8,seat was comfortable,Nicholas Blair,United Kingdom,2nd August 2015,,"Edinburgh to Tenerife return. Hadn't flown with easyjet for about 8 years, and having read some of the previous reviews, was not looking forward to these flights.  Nice new Airbus, seat was comfortable and plenty of room, even for me being of a larger build. Crew attentive and professional. All in all, very pleased, would consider them again on this route.",easyJet ,Economy Class,A320,3x3
6,okay for European journeys,Anthony Knifton,United Kingdom,23rd July 2015,,"A bit hard after a couple of hours, but okay for European journeys. I always book an 'extra legroom' seat because I am tall.",easyJet ,Economy Class,A320,3 x 3
10,best in flying and luxury experience,Francis Wong,Hong Kong,16th November 2021,1," This review refers to the Q suite, it really one of the very best in flying and luxury experience. It is almost like flying first class for the price of business. Try it for yourself if you can, you will see what I mean.",Qatar Airways ,Business Class,A350,1x2x1
9,Seat has a good legroom,R Narleva,United States,24th June 2021,1, Seat has a good legroom. The screen size was excellent and the provision of power supply is also commendable.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A350,3x3x3
10,a joy flying with you,Ruben Buizert,Belgium,17th April 2021,1," The service was extremely good and I like to personally name the crew on board who performed this service on flight QR 274 on the 16th of April 2021 from Amsterdam to Doha, thank you very much: Faishal, Rudy, Prudence and Lynda, it was a joy flying with you.",Qatar Airways ,Business Class,Boeing 777,1x2x1

10,Space between seats is good,David Calvet,Spain,11th August 2020,1," Seats in economy are quite comfortable, I could strech my legs , more or less (I am 180 cm). Space between seats is good. Very comfortable seats and very good reclining.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A350,2x3x2
10,comfortable for long haul flights,Christoph Giger,Switzerland,2nd May 2020,1," A319LR seat very comfortable, it is possible to lay down to horizontal. Easy handling. Good space for even larger peoples. A elder airplane with this new high class seat, this is special. Boeing 787-8 very comfortable, a full bed. Highly comfortable for long haul flights. No difference between this two aircraft seats!",Qatar Airways ,Business Class,A319 LR / Boeing 787-8,1x2x1
6,A320 good and comfortable,Ross Salamone,Italy,2nd January 2020,1, The economy class eat on A320 from Pisa to Doha was good and comfortable. Screen was not working but manager reset it for me. Seat on A380 from Doha to Melbourne was uncomfortable in comparison.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A320,3x3
10, up there with the best,Steven Neoh,Malaysia,28th December 2019,1," This is one of Qatar Airways newest Y products, so it's up there with the best of them. 9-across in an A350 gives about 18 inches of width, probably the best we can hope for in Cattle. The IFE touchscreen is responsive and the in-flight map is latest-gen and full of options; there's even a touchscreen remote controller for those who are into that sort of thing (I'm certainly not). Universal power points at every seat plus a USB port; bi-fold tray table to manage clutter; three-compartment seat pocket so things can be packed away according to size. Only complaint I have is that instead of the 6-way adjustable headrest they go with a 2-way adjustable with fixed wings. (Maybe this was a mid-range configuration; their longer-range A350-1000s have the 6-way headrests.)",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A350-900,3x3x3
7,Legroom was fine,W Garlen,United Kingdom,31st August 2019,1," Gatwick to Shanghai return via Doha. Both legs on a Boeing 777-300. The LGW-DIA leg was definitely an older aircraft as the in-flight entertainment was laggy. On-demand movies and TV at every seatback with USB charge socket was satisfactory. On all models of aircraft, the audio connection was a two-pin plug meaning your own headphones could not be used. Nice touch being able to play games with others on the plane. One hour free internet was also really nice touch and reasonable speed quality for emails and social media (not fast enough to post anything other than text/picture). Food was very nice. Good touches with menu given out and metal cutlery. Good drink service. Slightly frustrating that meal service is given shortly after takeoff, even at nearly 2am. Legroom was fine and recline was fine. Seat with at hips was fine however seat tapered to very narrow as it got higher. Most passengers of an average build will find their should overhangs into the aisle. Aisle is also very narrow. Aisle seat passengers are always bumped into.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3X3X3
9,seats had excellent legroom,Hemang Suthar,United States,8th July 2019,0," Very good economy class. When I flew from Dulles to Doha (14h flight), The economy class seats had excellent legroom and had a high definition IFE that had a large variety of movies and shows to watch. I was amazed at how the Flight Attendants were very helpful in helping the passengers getting to their seat. The food was excellent but had very little items to choose from. Though the aisle room was a bit small. Best flight I ever had! Thank you for the amazing flight!",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
10,It was very comfortable,A Madaliz,Jordan,26th June 2019,1," Flown on Qatar Airways new Boeing 777-300ER 10 abreast (3x4x3). I have read bad reviews about a 3x4x3 on Boeing 777, but I find it to be very good on Qatar Airways. The legroom was amazing! No IFE box blocking legroom, On Demand high resolution screens, excellent recline, good seat width, nice adjustable headrest. Good seat power supplies. The only negative thing Is aisles were a bit narrow, other than that, great seat. It was very comfortable for my almost 6 hour flight from Doha To Munich.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
8,The Qsuite is awesome,Faruk Muktadir,Bangladesh,22nd May 2019,1," The Qsuite is awesome with a massage option. Full flat Business class seat and very soft pillows was given. Mattress was very comfortable and handy for long haul flight. All direction movement control was available and arm rest can be dropped down fully to create extra space while sleeping. Only one improvement I would suggest, while sleeping with fully or almost fully flat seat sometimes legs are hit table tray sometimes or it creates barrier to stretch out legs. Seat storage was enough to keep my valuables, Qsuite is a great design to provide privacy during flight especially while sleeping.",Qatar Airways ,Business Class,A350 XWB,1X2X
2,old Boeing 777 business class,E Stoyal,Netherlands,4th March 2019,1," Very disappointed with the old Boeing 777 business class. Old, outdated seats. While some of their aircraft have beautiful business class sections, this is an old and ugly business class.",Qatar Airways ,Business Class,Boeing 777-300ER,2x2x2
10,the best in business class,P Michaels,Singapore,27th February 2019,1," Had the Qsuite single window seat that was forward facing on a flight to Singapore. What a fabulous seat and certainly the best in business class that I have flown. Very comfortable for sitting and relaxing, working and eating, and quite nice in the bed position. A lot of storage options, including the large armrest section. Door closed for sleep time and great privacy and peaceful on the A350. Footwell width area is less than you get in first class, but for business class I cannot complain. Highly recommended.",Qatar Airways ,Business Class,A350-900,1x2x1
4,seats were very cramped,J R Garin,United Kingdom,9th October 2018,1," LHR-DOH-CMB-LHR. Flying economy class on their newly configured Boeing 777-300ER. Flying in economy on the 10 abreast seat layout is highly overrated. Despite having good legroom (bulkhead seat on all flights) and having enough padding and recline, the seats were very cramped. Me and my partner both have broad shoulders (I am 5'7 and he is 6'1) and the seats meant our shoulders touching each others (though not minding at all as we are a couple- it just meant that his shoulder was touching his neighbours shoulder and had to fight for elbow room).",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
9,Seats are very comfortable,Sukhbir Kaur,United Kingdom,24th August 2018,1, My flight DOH to Paris and Back Paris to DOH was very pleasant on the A380. Seats are very comfortable. Touch screen TV quite advanced. Quite good leg room in economy class too. Will recommend this flight to others too.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
3,average seat place,Victor Sale,United Kingdom,11th May 2018,1," Really average seat place and IFE was basically not working, narrow space for the legs windows were dirty, and old furniture. The seat table was uncomfortable to eat as you could not put a big plate on it, and was making it even narrow. In general I slept during the flight because I had no chance to charge my phone, or watch a film, as the cabin crew was not able to change it in English, at least, from Arabic. After two hours the screen shut completely down",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A330-300,2x4x2
10,economy on 787-8 was excellent,Marc Russell,Australia,8th April 2018,1," I was returning from Rome and going back to Doha then Melbourne. Qatar airways economy on their 787-8 was excellent, it had reclining seats, leather headrests, adjustable headrests, good movies on the IFE, also universal power points in between the seats, USB ports to charger you device, a coat hanger, a tv remote which was touch screen and easy to use and also the mood light was terrific! Good job Qatar airways I will definitely fly with you again!

5,very hard and uncomfortable,H Morris,United Kingdom,14th March 2018,0,"❎  I was very impressed with all aspects of the service provided by all the flight and ground crew. They could not have been more helpful or considerate. The in flight service was conducted in a most pleasant and cordial manner. But the seats did not in my opinion come up to the same high standard. I flew from Manchester to Doha, on to Nagpur (on an A20) 05/03/2018 and returned a week later on the same route and aircraft. The flight to Nagpur and return were much more comfortable than the flights to and from Doha. The Boeing 787-8 3x3x3 format made the seats quite narrow, which I could cope with, being reasonably 'normal'. However I found the seat base to be very hard and uncomfortable. Anyone who managed to dream on this Boeing 787-8 must have been exhausted or of a stronger constitution than yours truly. ",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
9,seats were comfortable enough,Christina Houvarda,Greece,8th March 2018,0,"❎  Three friends and I flew Athens-Doha-Chennai and back with different aircraft types of Qatar Airways. We were all impressed - the seats were comfortable enough for economy seats, there was a pillow and a blanket on each seat, there was a monitor screen for every seat, the food with complimentary drinks, was quite good, as for the service it was just wonderful! Efficient, polite and caring stewards and stewardesses on the plane and equally good personnel on the ground! Security was excellent and all in all we had four pleasant flights, the best ever on any economy class flights we had flown the last years, as all airlines are offering less and less amenities through less and less caring staff nowadays!",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A330-300/200 and Boeing 787,2x3x2 / 3x3x3
9,seat was comfortable,M Garishvili,Georgia,2nd March 2018,1," The seat was comfortable, the leg room was OK for three hours flight. There was complimentary pillow and blanket on each seat. Each seat was equipped with IFE system and universal power socket. Though I had to share the power socket with the passenger sitting next to me, but it was ok as there was USB port on the screen of IFE system.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A320,3x3
9,seat was really comfortable,Giorgi Mosulishvili,Georgia,25th February 2018,1," The seat was really comfortable for the long-haul flight. Sometimes I have back pain during sitting for the long amount of time, but after the flight I didn't feel any pain. The legroom was also bearable, although I wish there was more legroom as I am very tall and it is always hard for me to find any room where I can put my feet. There was small box under the seat in front of me and it was bit annoying.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A330,2x4x2
8,seat and strange noise let it down for me,C Soble,United Kingdom,6th December 2017,1," I was travelling from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Doha with Qatar Airways, but on-board a couple of Boeing 787 it was tolerable but wasn't great. The legroom isn't great for people over six foot and trying to get past another passenger is very difficult (and the people next to me would not stand up) I was in the window seat 15/16A, which was nice (especially for sleeping) and the large window is great but had even less leg space due to the presence of a large silver IFE box. The seat recline was quite useless - it didn't seem to stay so you had to keep pressure leaning back (I don't normally recline anyway out of respect for others) Whenever the person in front reclined I was very cramped and couldn't move much - forget about accessing the aisle. Having 9 seats in each row is quite a lot in reality, it can result in some armrest battles with your neighboring passengers from slightly narrow seats. Maybe 8 would have given a better customer experience. Ironically my first flight to Doha had just 50 people on-board so I didn't have a problem there but my connections from then onward were much busier. Finally, there was a very annoying high pitched noise throughout the whole flight, which is either from the lights or the IFE boxes. It was rhythmic and once I had noticed it I couldn't ignore it sadly. On both of my Boeing 787 connections this noise was present so I know it wasn't this specific flight. Aside from the obligatory safety leaflet and an in-flight magazine (didn't know people still read these, hah) the seat storage was decent. On the whole I thought Qatar had very good service, all of the crew were lovely but the seat and strange noise let it down for me.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
2,Boeing 777-300ER was diabolical,P Sturgess,Australia,17th October 2017,," The flights from Doha to Europe were fine and the economy seats reasonably comfortable. The flight to Perth on the Boeing 777-300ER was diabolical. The seats are the narrowest I have encountered, I had a window seat and there was no space between the seat and wall of the aircraft at all. For an 11hr flight this is uncomfortable. Flying at 2am out of Doha the cabin crew took 2hrs before starting to serve a meal and another hour to collect trays. At 5am Doha time the sun was coming up and blinds were not shuttered so no sleep was had. ",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
8,seats had good width,Ashish Menon,United Arab Emirates,15th October 2017,," A330-300 seating system was 2-4-2, the seats were well spaced, enough space between the aisle seats, seats well cushioned and legroom space was also good. The recline of seats was really good, seats had good width and good back support. Storage space above was also very good.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A330-300,2x4x2
4,avoid the 787 in the future,Marc Pinol,Spain,17th August 2017,," I was excited to fly the Boeing 787 by Qatar, but it turned out to be disappointing. The seat pitch is not sufficient, I'm not especially tall (173) but my knees were almost touching the seat in front, and the box of the inflight entertainment located below the seats takes plenty of space. The Boeing 787 3x3x3 layout is not that convenient, more passengers have middle seats and you are bothered more often by other passengers who wish to stand up. I will avoid the 787 in the future.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
9,A380 seats comfortable,R Fimero,United Kingdom,28th July 2017,," I found the A380 seats comfortable, something that you expect from a great company even for economy tickets, they were comfy and with enough space even for tall people. I would definitely recommend, as even for a long flight like this case I did not feel uncomfortable.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A380,3x3x3
8,Seats were comfortable,Leon Ha,Australia,18th July 2017,," I flew from Doha to Perth on Qatar Airways Boeing 777-200. The aircraft is new and well-maintained. Seats were comfortable. Sufficient leg room (I am 1.75m tall) and seat pitch is wide enough. Sometimes I do find it difficult to sleep on plane but I slept through most of the flight. There is also USB connectivity that allows you to charge your devices but for some reasons it did not work on my seat. So I decided to indulge in the inflight entertainment system and work through Sudoku instead. Overall, a pleasant flight with Qatar Airways.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x3x3
9, very attentive flight attendants,I Main,Australia,11th June 2017,,"❎ Unverified |  We flew Melbourne to Edinburgh return via Doha. The long flights (MEL-DOH which were 14hrs) were actually the best experience. Very, very attentive flight attendants apart from one leg where it took an hour and a half after take off before we got any drink or snack - otherwise I've have scored them 10/10). Seemingly always bringing something to eat or drink. Good entertainment systems also for 11 yo daughter (although one of the screens had poor tough screen alignment making it very frustrating to select the right choices - although we got there in the end). USB power charging not working on two of the legs (across 6 seats near us). Very short stop-over times in DOH if you choose carefully (we got 2 hrs and 4 hrs - be careful of picking the 16hr stop over!).",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,3X4X3,June 2017
6,seats are much more cramped,David Gilbert,Italy,3rd April 2017,, Milan to Hong Kong Via Doha. I was excited to be on a Boeing 787 for the first time on the Doha Hong Kong legs and although very aesthetically pleasing the seats are much more cramped and hard compared to the more comfortable and spacious A330. Why do they do that? ,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
2,economy seats are cramped,Kenny Yu,Singapore,17th March 2017,," Flew Doha to Rome return, connecting from a Qatar Airways A350 flight. The 787 economy seats are cramped - and there are IFE boxes under the window and isle seat - making the leg room more cramped. I would not recommend it for flights above 2 hours.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
6,no power supply on A320 seats,James Thun,South Africa,5th March 2017,," We were seriously disappointed with a lack of individual inflight entertainment on this A320 and no power supply on the seats. The seats were basic and old. The old has it's Pro's and Con's, being old they had more cushion than lighter more modern seats, and felt more comfortable over a 5 hour stretch (can't say that for their B787 though), they also boasted some nice leg rests however both of ours didn't work and no one showed any interest in fixing it. Legroom near the window seat was hindered by the what seemed like an small entertainment box, although there was no individual in-flight entertainment system.  So all in all, the flight was more of a headache than it was a pleasure. If you have a kindle or similar, I'd say bring it. ",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A320,3x3
8,very comfortable for economy class,Daniel Lim,Malaysia,14th January 2017,," The Boeing 777 seats are very comfortable for economy class, it leave just enough space for the passengers to relax or to fall asleep, the adjustable pillow on the top of the seats are very clever try to suit to passengers different height, is one of the few airlines that I had experienced so far still feel rather relax and positive after 7/8 hours sit on the plane and leave the plane with a happy face
",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3
7,legroom is a big consideration,Ian Keane,Australia,12th November 2016,,"A380 return trip Sydney to Barcelona. Fortunate on the return leg that we were very early checking in and snagged an exit row seat. A definite bonus because on the leg Sydney - Doha we flew on an economy seat and the legroom was pathetic for a flight that length of time. The flight from Doha to Barcelona on a Boeing 787 had more legroom. Although everything else was great, legroom is a big consideration if you are over 1800mm so we won't be flying Qatar A380 next time unless we can guarantee an exit row seat or similar. Of course exit rows have their disadvantages too. Because they have bulkheads they are often reserved for babies in basinets. ",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
5,there is little leg room,D Kannar,Denmark,4th November 2016,,"I flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo on their Boeing 787. I have always been very happy flying with Qatar Airways and have used them many times now. But it is not what it has been. You sit too close, there is little leg room and I'm not so tall, 175cm. Service from CPH-DOH there were only two rounds of drinks, and food portions have been very small. I will avoid flying on the routes where they use the B-787.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-8,3x3x3
9,better compared to other airlines,Arvinth Arasu,India,28th July 2016,,"MAA-DOH was an A333 with a 2x4x2 configuration which seems to be old. The IFE was old and the options were good.  DOH-ATL a Boeing 777 200 LR with a 3x3x3 configuration. Which meant that the space was better compared to other airlines. Recline was very good too. ATL-DOH a 777 200 LR with the same configuration. Good seats, good food, Good IFE and a straight forward flight.  DOH-MAA an A330 with 2x4x2 configuration. Slept throughout the flight and missed the meal onboard. Overall a great experience with Qatar Airways.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777 / A330,"2x4x2, 3x3x3"
10,definitely choose to fly again,L Uthmeyer,Australia,17th July 2016,,"The flight Adelaide - Doha and return was awesome on the new A350 and everything about the flight was wonderful. The service was great and staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. The plane was so smooth and quiet that we almost didn't know we'd taken off. The seats are very comfortable as they have a larger recline than other airline seats in economy. The kids were kept entertained by the entertainment system although my 2 year old struggled as the 'baby shows' were mostly in Arabic. Even Sesame Street was an Arabic version. The food was excellent and even though my smaller child hadn't paid for a ticket she still received a meal of her own on every flight. Doha airport is new, clean and easy to navigate with a couple of play areas for kids. Also lots of spots for adults to chill out, watch tv, plug in phones to charge for free and food courts to eat in. Given the amazing rate I got and the fact that the plane was so new and the service so impeccable, I would definitely choose to fly Qatar again.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A350,3x3x3
8,seat was still relatively comfortable,K Ruslan,United Kingdom,15th July 2016,,Qatar Airways followed other airlines in changing the seating in their Boeing 777-300ER from 3x3x3 to 3x4x3. Surprisingly the seat was still relatively comfortable albeit the isle access was impacted. Overall a good seat and the price that I paid it was still superb value for money. Screen was good and fully working. Compared to European airlines Qatar Airways product is much better value for your money.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
8,changed seat configuration to 3-4-3,Waqas Alfarsi,Oman,9th July 2016,,"Qatar Airways old seats configuration on B777-300er used to be one of the most comfortable seats that I had among all the carriers that I have tried. Unfortunately they changed the seats configuration to 3-4-3. The new seats have less width and are not comfortable as they were before. I had an aisle seat on the route New York To Doha and people walking to the restroom often touched my shoulder. I was disappointed with the last flight, I think I will try my best to avoid this B777-300er. I recommend the airline but not this aircraft.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3
8,nice amenities were provided,Marc Pinol,Spain,8th July 2016,,"I was moved from the lower to the upper deck on the Qatar Airways A380, at my request. Very nice option as the economy cabin on the upper deck is much smaller, therefore feels more private, less crowded, and going to the lavatory becomes easier. 25K in the first row, window seat. This seat is great if you have a red eye flight, as feels more spacious, there is no seat in front of you, and so on. It feels less spacious, though, than the lower deck as the bulkhead is lower. But the good thing is that you have a small compartment between the seat and the window, and the distribution is 2x4x2. Seat was comfortable, easy to sleep there, and nice amenities were provided for this night flight.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2
5,avoid flying on Boeing 787,Alan Jackson,United Kingdom,22nd May 2016,,"Boeing 787, avoid flying on the Boeing 787 in economy. The seat width is terrible, the leg room is inadequate due to IFE boxes and once the seat in front is reclined you can't move in your seat. The IFE is class leading and they have a modern fleet but apart from these two points I feel that Qatar is living on a previous reputation.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
8,Seats were the perfect width,A Barnes,Bahrain,21st May 2016,," Flew from BAH-DOH-MAN Very good flight overall. Seats were the perfect width with ample leg room, however the padding in the seat could be improved. Food was, for once, nice and the flight attendants were lovely. Selection of movies was great and TV Shows were good; I did find that the power supply was confusing as I could not plug in my laptop charger, however could plug in my phone charger with both being 3 pin-plugs, even the flight attendant could not manage. Flight from Bahrain was refreshing, however to much to comment on when it is only 25 minutes. Stopover in Doha was lovely, the staff there are very helpful and friendly, and the airport is modern and easy to navigate.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER / A320,3x3x3
7,pushes my head slightly forward,T Penney,United Kingdom,18th May 2016,,"All is good except for one problem I have with Qatar Airways new A380 seats: I find that when the seat is in the upright position, which I mostly prefer even when sleeping/dozing, whatever position the new sliding head rest is in, it pushes my head just slightly forward of its natural upright 'fulcrum' position. This means that when I relax completely my head wants to flop forward with my chin on my chest. This is not good on a long haul flight. Luckily I am not too tall (5'7.5"") so if I push the headrest up completely and I slump slightly it almost clears the back of my head. This is comfortable and I can relax completely.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
9,seats are  comfortable enough,S Welsh,Australia,14th April 2016,,"Flew MEL to EDI via DOH with my 4 year old daughter, both the Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 787 are fine aircraft, the Boeing 777 seat feels slightly more spacious due to not having any boxes near your feet but otherwise the seats seems the same size and comfortable enough. Both IFE were consistent and excellent, they could potentially have done with slightly more content for children. My only negative would be that they serve the same child meals on each flight with no other options offered. Cabin crew were excellent, friendly and speedy with service, a must to ensure no spillages or accidents with kids and food trays. For an economy flight, service and value for money I don't believe there is a better airline to travel with.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777 / 787,3x4x3 / 3x3x3
10,best Economy seat I ever had,F Drexler,Austria,3rd April 2016,,FRA-DOH in Qatar Airways new A350. So far the best Economy seat I ever had with generous leg room and seat width. The whole cabin is spacious and extremely quiet. I also didn't spot any entertainment boxes which cut off leg room under any seat in the cabin. The seat tracks align with all seats so wherever you're seated you can stretch your legs forward. Pretty good IFE too.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A350-900,3x3x3
2,configuration feels cramped,F Drexler,Austria,3rd April 2016,,"I chose Qatar because according to their homepage at the time of booking they have a 3x3x3 layout in their 777-300 - which was true for the flight DOH-PER, but on the way back it was a new 3x4x3 configuration. While the old seats were quite spacious, the new configuration feels cramped. Very small entertainment boxes under some seats which aren't disturbing, but because of the extra seat in each row some seats don't align with the seat tracks and you can't stretch out your legs straight on all A, D, E, F, G and K seats. I had a C seat on both flights. Pretty comfortable on the 3x3x3 configuration, but not with the narrower isle on the 3x4x3 configuration, every person or trolley that passed ran into my shoulder and/or elbow. ",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x3x3 / 3x4x3
9,A330 was really good,Rajandeep Singh,United Kingdom,7th March 2016,,"The seat was pretty good for the A330 and the A321. The only thing with the A321 was that there wasn't much leg room. The A330 from Manchester was really good, the seat width was great and the aisle space wide enough to get past and also to stretch my leg. TV screen view was good because I was able to see what I was watching. ",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A330 / A321,2x4x2 / 3x3
10,best airline experience,J Bitar,Indonesia,28th February 2016,,"I travel an average of 6 times a year ever year and this was my best airline experience. Not only because of a great experience overall but because amid an unfortunate circumstance we could rely on efficient, honest and reliable people. My mother and I were traveling from Singapore to Paris for both leisure and Business. The trip felt short, and very smooth with a great choice of free movies. We had a very short and pleasant stopover in Doha where unfortunately my mum forgot her wallet (containing a very large sum of cash for the trip, all her credit cards, ID, drivers license, etc) on a seat in the boarding room of Hamad international airport! Luckily we were the last people to board the flight as we were sitting at the very end of the room- and thank goodness the Qatar staff are honest people with beautiful hearts and a great work ethic! I could not thank you all enough for all your help from efficiently locating the pouch to breezily contacting us to let us know and track down its every move all the way from Doha to Paris! Such brilliant people who effectively did their job and returned to us the wallet absolutely intact! Nothing was missing, and it this day and age this is very rare.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
10,A38 legroom is very spacious,Juraj Krajcik,Slovakia,26th February 2016,,"Cabin layout in Qatar Airways A380 looks very trendy with nice lighting system, enough space between the aisles. 3x4x3 is goods for the A380, but the same layout in 777 feels very tight. Legroom in economy class is very spacious. I advise to take window seat at the front of the aircraft.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A380,3x4x3
10,nicest Economy class seat,Tobias Boerner,United Kingdom,12th February 2016,,"This A350-900 of Qatar Airways had the nicest Economy class seat experience I have ever had. I am only small, but the space is more then I had in other economy seats, and seat comfort is wonderfull. Every seat was equipped with a 9"" Screen, a USB-Port (not only for charging your mobile, also to play music) and a remote control for the Screen. ",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A350-900,3x3x3
7,found seating uncomfortable,G Secomb,Australia,8th February 2016,,"Unfortunately Qatar Airways is following the industry trend with their new 777-300s. The DOH-BKK flight was on a new aircraft that was configured in the 3-4-3 seating layout. I found the seating uncomfortable and the cabin was jam-packed. Cabin crew were struggling to accommodate the passengers cabin baggage in the overhead lockers. Qatar Airways are a great airline, and have great service - but their new direction in cabin layout are concerning. Also flew on a 787 on the same journey - I agree with other reviewers.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300 ER,3x4x3
9,A350 seats very comfortable,Fawwaz Asrar,United Kingdom,7th February 2016,,A350 seats were very comfortable with good Leg space. Reclining Angle was more then the other airlines and a very good enviroment was created using lights. A330 seats were Ok. Leg space was just like some other airlines and reclining angle for seats was great. You cannot stretch your legs properly at window seats due to IFE box placed under seats,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A350-900 / A330,3x3x3 / 2x4x2
9,recommend Qatar Airways ,Firldeal Breure,United States,9th November 2015,,"I upgraded to Business class and enjoyed the first leg of the journey from Vietnam to Doha and enjoyed a fabulous flight. My seat was comfortable and did lay flat. Movie choices were somewhat limited, but found the selection varied and enjoyable. The second leg from Doha to Brussels was aboard a Boeing 787. My seat was in the front row and was tight for me, but should be comfortable for an average size person and under 6ft. I am very tall and had some extra space allotted to the first row giving me some much needed stretch room. In hindsight, wished I'd upgraded both flight legs from my origination airport as the price quoted was less expensive than that given in Doha. Thankfully the flight was less than six hours and the time went quickly. Seat reclined easily and was pleasantly surprised by the larger size of the bathroom. Was able to stretch effectively briefly. Stewards were very helpful throughout. When my selected meal did not meet my criteria, the concerned attendant offered a suitable replacement meal. I'd recommend Qatar Airways for their excellent service.",Qatar Airways ,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300,3x3x3
10,seats spacious and comfortable,Justin Mitchell,Australia,29th October 2015,,"I had not heard of the airline, and looked up Qatar Airways on Skytrax and was surprised to find a lot of positive reviews and a quick Google search gave me a lot of confidence. The flight itself was 2 international trips, Melbourne to Athens through Doha, and Madrid to Melbourne through Doha. The long legs between Melbourne and Doha were on the Boeing 777s in their 3x3x3 layout. Staff were extremely helpful and very accommodating, and a lot of diversity as well. Seats were spacious and comfortable and I never really felt uncomfortable or cramped. Food was pretty good and was delighted to be served several meals in my flight, with access to as much water, soda and snacks as I desired. In general, the staff were great, the planes were clean and tidy, the experience was top notch and I was extremely happy to fly with them. Best of all the flying was top notch without a single incident. Economy class took on a whole new meaning with Qatar and I'll fly with them again soon.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3
9,seat very comfy,Rebecca Hudson,United Kingdom,29th October 2015,,"Seat 22k I was in the window and as it wasn't a full flight we found the middle seat was free adding to the experience, making it feel like premium! At the bottom half of the wing, 3 rows from the toilets that I never heard once. Seemed to get fed our food first. Seat very comfy, could ask for nothing more, maybe the head support not to be totally fixed so I could lean on the window but it's so comfy I didn't mind. All window seats seem to have a aircon box by our feet reducing the space and not wide enough to fit a foot on the window side. Power didn't charge an iPad 4 but did an iPhone and blackberry.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787-800,3x3x3
9,Qatar Airways most certainly a cut above the rest,Gareth Bronkhorst,United Kingdom,19th September 2015,,"I recently had the pleasure to travel Business Class on Qatar Airways Boeing 787. The seat configuration is a 1x2x1, I chose the window seat. The seat itself is very comfortable and the offerings from Qatar Airways are most certainly a cut above the rest. You arrive to be immediately offered a cold towel and a beverage of your choice. I choose a glass of Champagne. This is served in a large champagne flute and it was just what you need to cool down after a very hot boarding procedure. I will focus more on seat quality in this review opposed to the entire service. The seat is comfortable to sit in and to relax in. It reclines into a fully flat position and it has various different settings. The only gripe I have is that the Fixed TV and tray table get very into the way of your sleep quality. Being very tall I kept banging my knee against the tray table that does fold away. That would be the only drawback I have, the rest of the seat is good and the quality of service from Qatar Airways is faultless. I will absolutely travel with Qatar again and in this seat. ",Qatar Airways ,Premium Economy,Boeing 787,1-2-1
8,great experience with Qatar Airways,Ali Mehar,United States,1st September 2015,,"I flew for the first time with Qatar Airways, JFK-DOH-LHE. The check-in process was very fast because I checked in online. Food was great, and cabin staff was very helpful. Even though my return flight was delayed 2hrs from Lahore due to mechanical issue, when we arrived at DOH ground staff expedited us to JFK flight. Overall, a great experience with Qatar Airways.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x3x3
10,big comfortable seats,Julian Zauner,Australia,12th August 2015,,Brand new aircraft. Big comfortable seats and an amazing entertainment system.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A350,3x3x3
10,aircraft is lovely,E Pauler,United Kingdom,27th July 2015,,"This is the second flight I have taken with Qatar Airways from Edinburgh to Cape Town. I found this the best airline I have travelled with, I travel wheelchair assistance and found the staff friendly and very helpful. The aircraft is lovely and TV screen good, leg room good, food good, and the fresh coffee was the best - I would give them 5 stars.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
7,decent legroom,B Vincent,Australia,20th June 2015,,"Comfortable seat, decent legroom, good inflight entertainment screen. The only let-down was that the armrests could only be raised to about 60 degrees. ",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x3x3
8,seat is comfortable,Pedro Guerra,Brazil,15th June 2015,,"The seat is comfortable because has a support for the head. The pitch is good, comfortable for the legs. The best is the screen in each seat, big with many movies, musics, series, tv shows, etc.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3X3X3
2,A330 seats were much wider,J Scholfield,United Kingdom,14th June 2015,,"Very narrow seats, flew out on QR2 and it was full and felt claustrophobic even though I was in the aisle. Came back on the A330 and seats were much wider. Qatar Airways are very good,just don't fly on their 787.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3
9,excellent seats ,D Joseph,United States,4th June 2015,,DOH-PHL economy with Qatar Airways on B777-200LR. Excellent seats comparable to the ones in Emirates A380.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200LR,3x3x3
3,A380 was a pure dream,Emil Holmgren,Sweden,3rd June 2015,,I was looking forward to a comfortable ride since the 787 is a new aircraft and Qatar Airways is a quality airline. I had very little space for my feet and had to sit in an uncomfortable position to fit. Also the reading lights were pointed at you and not on your newspaper which made reading in the dark impossible. I will not book a flight with Qatar Airways 787 again. The connecting flight I had with Qatar Airways A380 was a pure dream by comparison!,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
9,the recline is incredible,R Walmsley,Australia,30th May 2015,,Perth-London return the 777 for 3 of the 4 flights. 37A and then 28C and 27C. I think the seat size on all was generous - probably the widest I've sat in. The recline is incredible not good though if you want to sit upright and the one in front reclines! I was lucky to have no one next to me on 2 of the 4 flights so plenty of room. Also feet room was good (no box) could stretch right out. Only thing that bugged me was the touch screen. Didn't work well on both return flights. had to end up trying to navigate with the touch pad. a tad frustrating. Would book again.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x3x3
8,my favourite economy airline,Richard Flitcroft,Australia,5th February 2015,,The most comfortable economy flight I've had. The 787 is much less comfortable. But on both aircraft the staff provided exceptional service. This is my new favourite economy airline. I had been a Qantas devotee but this surpasses it by miles.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2
9,seat offers a generous 32x185 dimension,Willy Fischer,France,28th January 2015,,Qatar Airways A380 Doha to Paris 26 Nov 2014. Economy seat 31G (upper deck). In their brand new A380 Qatar Airways made the excellent choice to keep some economy seats in the upper deck frequent flyers will appreciate. The seat offers a generous 32x185 dimension in a quiet 2x4x2 configuration. TV screen wifi (fee) USB plug AC power for smartphone (AC power was not working). Service excellent with Qatar Airways crew outstanding.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2
2,leg room was similar to a budget airline,J Morley,United Kingdom,28th January 2015,,Colombo to Doha a five hour flight en route to London and the leg room was similar to a budget airline.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A321,3x3
3,avoid to travel with this type of airplane,Michel Vekemans,Belgium,28th January 2015,,Avoid to travel with this type of airplane from Qatar airways fleet. The Qatar Airways Boeing 777 or A330 are more comfortable.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
5,tv screen far too close to their face ,L Buttle,United Kingdom,21st January 2015,,The economy seat reclines a bit further than many others. Not a good thing for the passenger behind who either has their tv screen far too close to their face or anything on their table is dumped into their lap when the seat is reclined. It happened to 2 people on my flight and very nearly to me.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER/b〉,3x3x3
8,legroom was more than enough,Ivana Pantovic,Argentina,19th November 2014,,One of the best economy class seats I know. I am 5'9'' and legroom was more than enough. Recline was better than most airlines. Screen had a pretty wide adjustment angle so I had no problem to watch the program regardless of how reclined was the seat in front of me. At the meal time there was enough room to use the tray table without the passenger in front putting their seat in the upright position. Good choice of entertainment. the only downside was that the seat was a little hard. Summing it up a very good overall experience.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200LR,3x3x3
3,seats are narrow and too close together,William Lawton,United Kingdom,19th November 2014,,Manchester - Doha - Singapore. The A330 was quite comfortable enough legroom. The B787 seats are narrow and too close together you struggle to get in and out of them. The entertainment box situated under the seat restricts your legroom by about 1/3rd.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
1,experience was unbearable for me,H Boudjemai,United Kingdom,12th August 2014,,I'm a short guy and the experience was unbearable for me. The seats are slim without much foam for back support. The legroom is impeached by the entertainment box attached to the seat with make seating straight impossible even for my short legs. The aisle seat's inconvenience are the entertainment box and the reduced aisle which will provide you a bumpy ride from other passing passengers or carts. If you think the middle seat is your saver. When you recline the seat is move forward which turn your knee as an entertainment tv stand. I would advise that you fly Qatar Airways Airbus or Boeing 777 where comfort is very satisfactory.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
8,one of the best you could ever get,H Zhang,China,28th July 2014,,"That was one of the best you could ever get on a long-haul flight. I was worrying about the seat before the flight because I am 5'9"" and a quite heavy weight. But once I got seated there was still space between me and the bar and the legrooms were still lots left.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x3x3
4,cramped economy seat,Tony Regan,Singapore,21st July 2014,,Cramped economy seat made particularly uncomfortable as entertainment system takes up considerable space in the foot well. Have to sit with legs at an angle to avoid the box. Exceptionally uncomfortable flight.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
3,one of the better economy seats,I Blakely,Australia,18th July 2014,,Qatar B777 long haul MEL-DOH experience was good. One of the better economy seats plus good service. However the new B787 (DOH-BRU return) horrible. Main problem is the entertainment system box which intrudes into legroom for A C D F G and K seat. It occupies about one third of the space directly in front of the seat. On one sector the middle seat was empty so sitting on an angle made it almost tolerable but on the return the middle seat was occupied and I had to squeeze my foot between the seat support and the curved sidewall. Other Qatar flights maybe but if it involves a connection in DOH to a 787 forget it.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
4,the narrowest seats I have seen,Vineet Garg,India,15th July 2014,,This Boeing 787 has the narrowest seats I have seen in some time. Be prepared to knock your elbows with your co-passenger or if they are of large built they will spill over in your seat. Compared to the A330 seats of Qatar these are a nightmare. The leg room is also not good and once the person in front of you reclines you are done for.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
8,system was bit outdated and hard to use,Anil Tanwani,Nigeria,12th January 2014,,Great seat comfort amongst all other middle east carriers. good food courteous staff. Overall it was a relaxing journey from Lagos - Doha - Delhi. The bus transfers at Doha International airport are really tiring and wish something done about it on an urgent basis. The remote control for the in flight entertainment system was bit outdated and hard to use.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A330-300,2x4x2
9,I was very comfortable onboard,J Tinning,Austria,12th January 2014,,I was very comfortable onboard. I was able to charge my phone via USB on the tv screen. However I did have to place the pillow underneath me as the seat was a little hard.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200,3x3x3

9,the best economy class seat,Emil Nazri,Oman,12th January 2014,,This is the best economy class seat. Took 2 flights from Muscat to Heathrow (transit in Doha) and I was still feel as fresh as ever when landed in T3. The seat is big enough for me and the leg room still has some space (I'm 5'8 btw). The food and cabin crew were superb.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A330-300,2x4x2
10,extremely comfortable for economy,Susan Freeman,Vietnam,12th January 2014,,Extremely comfortable for economy. We really appreciated the kit (socks eye-mask earplugs toothbrush/paste). Food was above average for economy. Best of all was the in-flight entertainment system. Very large screens and a huge choice of films games tv shows.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x3x3

7,seats are comfortable enough,M Bertram,Australia,15th February 2013,,While the legroom isn't fantastic the seats are comfortable enough and the recline is nice. Certainly enough room for the short 3 hour flight that we took.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,AIRBUS A321,3x3
10,lots of legroom,C Andersson,Sweden,24th December 2012,,Comfortable seats with lots of legroom. Qatar Airways entertainment system is real easy to handle.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x3x3
10,a cut above most airlines,R Elliott,United Kingdom,23rd December 2012,,Qatar Airways service and food are a cut above most airlines. Boeing 787 the plane wasn't super clean the seats are kind of narrow especially with the IFE box at your feet. I think Qatar should explore installing a Premium Economy seat for people like me who can't necessarily afford Business class but are happy to pay a little extra for a humane amount of space on long haul flights.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3
10,really comfortable and relaxing,Marco Rodriguez-Novas,Spain,17th September 2012,,Madrid to Doha on Boeing 777-300ER. We got seats 28A/B/C/D. The food was fantastic and the crew on this flight was really friendly and young. The seat was really comfortable and relaxing. Oryx Entertainment- system was really good. The only annoying thing on this flight was the menu. Instead of giving us a menu on paper they stopped the entertaining system and they put the menu on the screen. And after about 15 minutes you could use the entertaining system again.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x3x3
10,my most comfortable long haul flight,R Graham,United Kingdom,9th September 2012,,"LHR-DOH-BKK. My wife and I have travelled in aircraft with the same seat pitch (34"") before but never one so wide in economy (18.9""). I am 6' 4"" tall and this was my most comfortable long haul flight ever. The ability to pre-book a row of just two seats was a bonus and made access even easier.",Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300ER,3x3x3
9,leg room is generous,Boris Orenic,Slovakia,22nd October 2011,,I'm 186 cm tall and I found the seats on QR's A320 really comfortable. Leg room is generous and the seats recline well.

9,in terms of legroom it was excellent,Rameen Azmat,Canada,10th August 2011,,Montreal to Doha and aircraft was very comfortable compared to other airlines. In terms of legroom it was excellent - it was 34 inches. The seat reclined pretty good.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200,3x3x3
9,there was ample legroom,Steve Tovey,United Kingdom,9th June 2011,,There was ample legroom (I'm 6') even when the seat in front reclined and the IFE system was second to none. The recline was about right.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,BOEING 777,2x4x2
10,comfortable and with enough space,Simon Bott,United Kingdom,25th October 2010,,I am a 6'2 broad guy and normally find airline seats uncomfortable and restricting on my knees - however Qatar economy seats are the best I have found yet comfortable and with enough space to stretch my legs out.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A340,2x4x2

9,easy to stretch out legs,Michael Davies,United Kingdom,10th November 2009,,Sat in 40B just at the point where the aircraft begins to narrow - but this didn't seem to impact on space. Easy to stretch out legs under seat in front. Be aware that window seats and aisle seats on the centre section have the AVOD box. Probably best economy cabin I've travelled in.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A330-300,2x4x2
8,cabin extremely airy,J Keith,Netherlands,10th December 2008,,FRA-DOH. Cabin extremely airy giving the passenger a very spacious and clean feeling. All the window seats have an entertainment box which is very uncomfortable in terms of legroom. Overall a very comfortable experience with excellent seat width.,Qatar Airways ,Economy Class,A330-200,2x4x2
9,we could sleep on both flights,Davide Zara,Italy,20th August 2008,,MXP to SIN. The connection was really bad as we had to wait 7 hours in Doha airport.
